Do you know that poem of Baudelaire's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q501]? It's something at the end of the world. He\u2019s speaking to his beloved, very simple. You know, lots of the German Romanticism was very simple.\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:01:30\nReads \"Invitation Au Voyage: II\".\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:03:15\nWell let's go back to the old poems then, that have been published. Stuart Montgomery, well it doesn't matter. But that--I can send it off to England [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q21] to the Fulcrum Press [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5507820] doing a lot of Basil Bunting [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2886803] and the English poet of 65, resuscitated in America [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30] again, it's about time.\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:03:44\nReads \"Long Nook\" [from Ace of Pentacles].\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:04:38\nI'll just make random choices. \"At Big Sur\".\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:04:53\nReads \"At Big Sur\u201d [from Ace of Pentacles].\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:05:12\n\"Louise\".\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:05:21\nReads \"Louise\" [from Ace of Pentacles].\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:05:48\n\"The Pool of Light\".\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:05:53\nReads \"The Pool of Light\" [from Ace of Pentacles].\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:06:14\nFor Mari--No, this is \u201cFor Marion\".\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:06:19\nReads \"For Marion\" [from Ace of Pentacles].\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:07:05\n\u201cThe Mermaid Song\u201d, forgive me for this, I thought the other poems would carry me through, but I'm reading and keeping with the mood for tonight, it seems to be more lyrical. \"The Serpent's Hiss\".\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:07:52\nReads \"The Serpent's Hiss\" [published later in Selected Poems, 1958-1984].\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:08:37\nAnd this is called \"Tuesday, 5 pm\".\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:08:43\nReads \"Tuesday, 5 pm\" [published later as \u201cTuesday 7:00 PM\u201d in Selected Poems, 1958-1984].\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:10:45\nI'm going to read the \"The Imperatrice\". Ace of Pentacles is a card in the Tarot deck, but the book should be called \u2018pente\u2019 which all the words that appeared in a hypnagogic vision, hypnagogic is the state between waking and sleeping, it's what Jung [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q41532] practiced and his Marie Louise Franz would take down the things that came to him in the state between waking and sleeping and the letters \u2018pente\u2019 appeared in that state and I didn't know what they meant so I kept hunting around and I made the word 'pinnacles' out of it and somebody said why don't you call it \"Ace of Pinnacles\" and we made a whole thing about the Tarot deck, but that's not the title of the book. It should be \u2018pente\u2019 and that's from the Greek  which is \u2018wall\u2019. And I'd like have as a fronts piece for the book William Blake's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q41513] \"The Chimney Sweep\"  [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2587725] the second version of that from the \"Songs of Experience\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q27890603] when he says that my mum and father have gone up to the church to pray and they make a heaven of my misery. That kind of thing. Imperatrice there's another card from the Tarot deck it's the third card of the deck.\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:12:09\nReads \"The Imperatrice\" [published later in Selected Poems, 1958-1984].\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:13:38\nThere is something else I thought I'd like to read after that one. I'll read a poem for Sylvia Plath [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q133054] who was an American poet who married an English man, Ted Hughes [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q272194] and had mental troubles and wrote a novel about it called The Bell Jar [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1213085] under a pseudonym Victoria Lucas, so not to embarrass her mother, and then things became too much for her and I think in 1963, she did away with herself in London [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q84], and it was a great loss, some people feel that and some do not, they feel that at least--Lowell has written an introduction to her poems posthumously printed called Ariel [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q224733] and her first book was The Colossus [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q29889462]. But Victoria Lucas was, The Bell Jar, was, you could buy it through William Hiderman and it came down from Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16] to the United States and it's never been printed in the country. This is \"The Suicide\".\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:15:06\nReads \"The Suicide\" [published later in Selected Poems, 1958-1984].\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:16:57\nLet's read some happy poems, I'm getting depressed.\n\nUnknown\n00:17:03\n[Cut or edit made in tape].\n\nJohn Wieners\n00:17:04\nReads \"Ode on a Common Fountain\" [from Ace of Pentacles; recording jumps to mid-poem].\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:19:51\nThat's the first poem, I ever, I was twenty, so that was twelve years ago, that poem was written. Now I can go back--I'm still writing about Acis [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q419156] and Galatea [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q241070] but these are terribly sentimental and distraught, drunken poems, you can call them. Maybe we'll have one more, or is that anything from that first reading that you'd like to hear again? I'd rather not go into it. [Unknown audience member suggests poem. Title unintelligible]. Okay, that's what Spender [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q448764] did say to me, he said you look like a de-frocked priest, so. Which I thought was awfully cruel, but I think I am one, my sister was a nun, I'll be a priest. Poets are priests, you know.\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:20:54\nReads \u201cThere are holy orders in life...\u201d [published later in Selected Poems, 1958-1984].\n \nEND\n00:21:42\n"

In 1934, Wieners earned a B.A. in English from Boston College, and subsequently worked at Harvard University\u2019s Lamont Library. A 1955 poetry reading by Charles Olson inspired Wieners to attend Black Mountain College in North Carolina, where he met and was mentored by Charles Olson and Robert Duncan. After completing studies in 1956, John Wieners moved back to Boston and started Measure, a (short-lived) literary magazine, as well as becoming involved in the Poet\u2019s Theater in Cambridge. At the age of 24, (in 1958) Wieners moved to San Francisco and met Beat Poets Jack Kerouac, Jack Spicer and Allen Ginsberg, and published his first book of poems, The Hotel Wentley Poems (Dave Haselwood Publishing, 1965). John Wieners\u2019 San Francisco journal, The Journal of John Wieners Is To Be Called 707 Scott Street for Billie Holiday, 1959, was published in 1966 by Sun & Moon Press. Wieners wrote plays that were never published during this time, until 1964 when he published Ace of Pentacles (published by James F. Carr & Robert A. Wilson). Charles Olson asked Wieners to be a graduate student and a teaching assistant at the State University of New York at Buffalo in 1965, and Wieners eventually became the university\u2019s chair of poetics, when he left by 1967. John Wieners suffered from mental illness, and was institutionalized for the second time in 1969, where he wrote Asylum Poems (For My Father) (Press of the Black Flag Raised). In 1970, he published Nerves (Cape Goliard Press), an internationally published book of poetry, and between 1967 to 1972, he published six smaller books of poetry. Behind the State Capitol; or, Cincinnati Pike (Good Gay Poets Press) was published in 1975 and thus marked the last of his published poems. John Wieners\u2019 poetry, while highly appraised by Beat Poets, Black Mountain Poets and his peers, did not achieve wide public acclaim or readership. In 1985, however, Selected Poems, 1958-1984 (Black Sparrow Press) was compiled with the help of Robert Creeley and Allen Ginsberg. In the 70\u2019s, John Wieners lived and became involved with anti-war movements and became an activist for gay rights, living at 44 Joy Street in Boston. Becoming more and more reclusive after the mid 70\u2019s, John Wieners died of an apparent stroke on March 1, 2002. Michael Carr edited a posthumous collection of Wiener\u2019s 1971 journals which was published in 2007."

Ace of Pentacles is a card in the Tarot deck, but the book should be called \u2018pente\u2019 which all the words that appeared in a hypnagogic vision, hypnagogic is the state between waking and sleeping, it's what Jung [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q41532] practiced and his Marie Louise Franz would take down the things that came to him in the state between waking and sleeping and the letters \u2018pente\u2019 appeared in that state and I didn't know what they meant so I kept hunting around and I made the word 'pinnacles' out of it and somebody said why don't you call it \"Ace of Pinnacles\" and we made a whole thing about the Tarot deck, but that's not the title of the book. It should be \u2018pente\u2019 and that's from the Greek  which is \u2018wall\u2019. And I'd like have as a fronts piece for the book William Blake's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q41513] \"The Chimney Sweep\"  [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2587725] the second version of that from the \"Songs of Experience\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q27890603] when he says that my mum and father have gone up to the church to pray and they make a heaven of my misery.

I'll read a poem for Sylvia Plath [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q133054] who was an American poet who married an English man, Ted Hughes [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q272194] and had mental troubles and wrote a novel about it called The Bell Jar [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1213085] under a pseudonym Victoria Lucas, so not to embarrass her mother, and then things became too much for her and I think in 1963, she did away with herself in London [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q84], and it was a great loss, some people feel that and some do not, they feel that at least--Lowell has written an introduction to her poems posthumously printed called Ariel [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q224733] and her first book was The Colossus [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q29889462]. But Victoria Lucas was, The Bell Jar, was, you could buy it through William Hiderman and it came down from Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16] to the United States and it's never been printed in the country. This is \"The Suicide\".\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:15:06\nReads \"The Suicide\" [published later in Selected Poems, 1958-1984].\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:16:57\nLet's read some happy poems, I'm getting depressed.\n\nUnknown\n00:17:03\n[Cut or edit made in tape].\n\nJohn Wieners\n00:17:04\nReads \"Ode on a Common Fountain\" [from Ace of Pentacles; recording jumps to mid-poem].\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:19:51\nThat's the first poem, I ever, I was twenty, so that was twelve years ago, that poem was written. Now I can go back--I'm still writing about Acis [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q419156] and Galatea [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q241070] but these are terribly sentimental and distraught, drunken poems, you can call them. Maybe we'll have one more, or is that anything from that first reading that you'd like to hear again? I'd rather not go into it. [Unknown audience member suggests poem. Title unintelligible]. Okay, that's what Spender [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q448764] did say to me, he said you look like a de-frocked priest, so. Which I thought was awfully cruel, but I think I am one, my sister was a nun, I'll be a priest.

So please don't all crowd into the room. If you are going to lean against the paintings, we shall never be able to get this room again for poetry readings. Because this, this is a gallery which belongs to the Fine Arts department, we had great difficulty getting it, these paintings are very precious, particularly to the artists themselves [audience laughter]. I would ask you please to stay away from the paintings. That must have been the artist [audience laughter]. We are also waiting for the arrival of someone else, so please be patient. Howard--[audience laughter] can you ask the security people to turn on the cooling system, the hall is going to be too hot.\n \nUnknown\n00:01:22\nAmbient Sound [voices].\n \nHenry Beissel\n00:01:25\nWe may get 927.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:01:30\nWhat do you mean, we may, I think they're also--okay. What would you like to do? Let us stay here or move?\n \nAudience\n00:01:41\nStay here.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:01:44\nOkay, with the people, there are some people who are at the back of the door, there is some space up here at the front if you'd like to come up.\n \nHenry Beissel\n00:01:54\nNo more than ten.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:01:58\nAbout ten. It'll make more room at the back too...If everybody on the chairs would shift over this way, um, and sit on, sort of as if it were a bench, then some more people can sit on the edges there. Or just move the chairs all that way. Move the rows forward. They're all shifting over anyway. Could you all move your chairs forward to make the rows as close together as possible. Okay, it's alright. \n\nUnknown\n00:03:17\nAmbient Sound [voices].\n\nMargaret Atwood\n00:04:41\nThere are these uhh--woohoo--there are these speakers outside and you might be more comfortable if you went out and listened over the speakers, some of the people are really jammed in there. I don't see any reason why this thing should resemble a steam bath, for all of us. If you're--what? what?...I don't think I can, what is it that they do? [Audience laughter].\n \nWynne Francis\n00:05:19\n[Laughter]. Miss Atwood [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q183492] has just upstaged the introducer. Good evening ladies and gentlemen. It's not often that an artist excels in two medium such as poetry and fiction as our guest tonight does. Miss Atwood's reputation as a superior poet was established in the 60's with her first collections, The Circle Game [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7723073] and The Animals in that Country [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7713834]. And while continuing to write fine poetry, six major collections to date, she's given  us two novels in the last five years, The Edible Woman [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7731579] and Surfacing. With the second novel, published late in 1972, within a few months of a controversial work of criticism, Margaret Atwood became one of Canada's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16] best known literary artists. The hypothesis of Survival, a study of patterns in Canadian lit is that Canadians see themselves as victims. I was remind of Survival recently when I came across a nineteenth-century curiosity written by one John McTaggart [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q463553]. It was a book published in London [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q84] in 19-- excuse me--1829. McTaggart wrote \"There's a melancholy which is peculiar to Canadians which must be combatted. People who labor under it must be encouraged, the soothing language, good treatment and now and then as circumstances require, a little assistance gratis as a stimulant.\" McTaggart's third point about the helpful effects of a little assistance as a recent theory has been taken up by the Canada Council [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2993809], to whom we are in part indebted for her appearance tonight. Margaret Atwood's work constitutes an exploration of what it means to be a Canadian, to be a woman and to be a human being. She writes about our totems, our tapestry of manners, our progressive insanities. She taught at Sir George in 67-68, and it's a great pleasure to have her return to us tonight. After her reading, she'll be open to questions from the audience. Ladies and gentlemen, Margaret Atwood.\n\nAudience\n00:07:27\nApplause [cuts out briefly].\n\nMargaret Atwood\n00:07:38\nLet's see now, if the mic starts to get funny, let me know...Too loud?...Not too loud, I'm afraid it isn't a very good mic and also I'm afraid I'm going to have to hold it the whole time which is a bore...I don't think it'll work very well, is that better? Does that work? Higher? Lower? Okay, how's that? Okay, I'm going to read entirely from my new book which is called \"This is\"--oh, what is it called? [audience laughter]. It's called You Are Happy. Somebody who has been photographing me says that a friend of hers was in a bookstore and picked out this book and thought at first that this was one of these \"I'm Okay, You're Okay\" books. Until I saw who wrote it. [Audience laughter]. But it has a happy ending, you'll be pleased to know. And I'm going to begin at the beginning and end at the end. Skipping portions along the way. I'm also going to make this reading fairly short because we are all in this rather constricted situation. I used to tell people when people in the States [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30] used to ask me \u201cdo you live in an igloo\u201d and other questions like that, I used to think to myself that being a Canadian was sort of like living in a chicken coop in the middle of the desert. That everybody was all together in one place but there are these huge spaces around. I wish that  we had been provided with one of them. [Audience laughter]. I have a chicken coop, and you're nicer. But there are more of you. I think we will all have to be very, very patient, unlike the chickens. I'm going to begin by reading a poem called \"Newsreel: Man and Firing Squad\".\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:10:04\nReads \"Newsreel: Man and Firing Squad\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:11:42\nReads \"Useless\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:12:35\nThis is--the image in this next poem comes from, begins with the fact that I have a sheep and one of them died. The poem is called \"November\".\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:12:48\nReads \"November\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:13:52\nReads \"Repent\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:14:47\n\"Tricks with Mirrors\". How are you doing? Is it hot and steamy? Has anybody died yet?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:15:05\nReads \"Tricks with Mirrors\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:17:45\nThis is the title poem, \"You Are Happy\".\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:17:50\nReads \"You are Happy\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:18:48\nReads \"First Prayer\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:20:25\n\"Is \/ Not: 1\". Oh boy, is it ever hot in here. I can't stand it. Light. I wonder if we could--well, then I can't see, you see. I wonder if we could turn off--would it be better if we turn off those lights that are grilling you over there...I could what?...Where's the light switch anyway? Howard, turn off the lights?...Well, maybe in a few minutes the lights will go off. Where did\u2026\n\nUnknown\n00:21:36\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed]. \n\nMargaret Atwood\n00:21:37\nHooray, wonderful. Actually, there's a light under here. It's like the Saturday movies [audience laughter]. No, I can read with this, yeah. Maybe I'll just read a little something else here, because it's the Saturday Movies.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:22:18\nReads [\"You take my hand\" from Power Politics; audience laughter throughout].\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:23:13\nAnd since we were talking about the war between Superman [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q79015] and Captain Marvel [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q534153] at dinner, my favourite was Plastic Man [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q746838], but that was an esoteric taste. I'll read this one.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:23:28\nReads \"They Eat Out\" [from Power Politics].\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:24:44\nI go to--I can't resist this. This is from the new book, it's called \"Siren Song\". Students of Seventeenth Century Literature are always asking themselves and each other, what song the sirens sang, and this is the ultimate answer.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:25:06\nReads \"Siren Song\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:26:12\nThe imminent critic, Allen Pearson, who was once known when he lived in Montreal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q340] as the Montreal Poet, now that he lives in Toronto [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q172], he's probably known as the Toronto Poet, says the following: \"Siren Song tells how boring it is for a woman to be obliged to attract men by appealing to them for help\". [Audience laughter]. Um, since I'm on the subject of people in capes and costumes, I'll read...\n \nUnknown\n00:26:56\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n\nAnnotation\n00:26:57\nReads [untitled poem from the \u201cCircle\/Mud Poems\u201d section in You Are Happy].\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:28:20\nReads \"Is \/ Not\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:30:37\nI think I'd better read just three more poems, before we all die. The first one is called \"There is Only One of Everything\".\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:30:54\nReads \"There is Only One of Everything\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:32:30\nReads \"Late August\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:33:26\nThis is the last poem, called \"Book of Ancestors\".\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:33:33\nReads \"Book of Ancestors\" from You Are Happy. \n \nAudience\n00:36:31\nApplause [cuts out briefly].\n\nWynne Francis\n00:36:47\nThank you, it's really not so hot if you sit still. Miss Atwood is prepared to discuss, for a little while.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:37:04\nIf you would like to, uh, I can't see a thing of course, I can sort of see hands if you stick them up and wave them around. Would that be better than turning back on the lights which I'd prefer not to do?\n \nWynne Francis\n00:37:22\nThere's no way we can get mics in the audience, so please speak loudly.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:37:23\nI see a hand.\n \nAudience Member 1\n00:37:28\nHow did your nickname of a witch get originated?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:37:30\nHow did my nickname of a witch? Are you referring to the speech I gave the other night at Loyola? Oh, it's, I was talking about a couple of reviews, that seemed to credit me with having these supernatural powers, you know, the ability to hypnotize my readers and things like that, and what I was saying was that in fact I don't in fact possess the powers of hypnotism or I'd use them on my bank manager and be quite rich. Um, I was talking about a pattern that seems to crop up from time to time in a certain kind of review usually written by men. [Audience laughter]. I heard that there were a couple of people in the audience at Loyola who before the speech, were convinced that I was a witch and that I was going to talk about witchcraft, and when I said that I wasn't one, they left. [Audience laughter]. You see, if I were a witch, I wouldn't be able to wear the cross. So that's how you can tell I'm not. Wards off vampires. Um, yes?\n \nAudience Member 2\n00:38:54\nUm, [unintelligible] and as well as the Edible Woman, I seem to get this idea of an emergence from greyness, or darkness and I was wondering if it's through this emergence from greyness that you have any reference to Blake [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q41513] in his emergence from chaos.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:39:17\nI'll be very flattered, if I did. I'm afraid I suffer by the comparison. I think that you're right in spotting it, I think I would say that it's more like this, that if you want to think in terms of colour, that you start with a grey, and then you go down. Down into, well, it depends on the poem or the book or whatever of what's happening in your life. And, but you have to go down before you come up again otherwise you stay just in the grey part. If you want a real pattern for this, it's Dante's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1067] Inferno [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4509219], where the man starts in a wandering wood, you know he starts in a kind of state of being lost, and then he goes down into hell. The further down he goes the more tortured souls he sees, but when he gets right to the bottom he finds that he's going up again. And then he comes out the other side.\n \nAudience Member 2\n00:40:19\nYeah, but, in this other side-ness in the Edible Woman you come up through colours, a very [unintelligible] of colours and I was wondering if this is the complete emergence of man?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:40:29\nNot complete--I would say no, no beginning.\n \nAudience Member 2\n00:40:32\n[Unintelligible] complete--into his universal aspect, but into an emergence of man. Into the colours of life.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:40:39\nYour choice of the word 'man' is interesting. Since the heroine is a woman. [Audience laughter and applause]. Um, I think you have the pattern right. I wouldn't like to attach any sort of universal meaning to it.\n \nAudience Member 2\n00:40:56\nNo I'm not attaching a universal meaning, I'm attaching more or less a universal meaning to the colour of darkness or greyness.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:41:04\nNo, that's right, you're correct. Yes.\n \nAudience Member 2\n00:41:07\nI'm not trying to express a universal meaning into these colours, this is where you're taking it wrong.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:41:14\nWell, I'm not too sure what we're talking about  to tell you the truth. You've spotted a correct pattern and I'm not too sure how one interprets it because I don't like to be the critic of  my own work in a way if you know what I mean. Yes.\n \nAudience Member 3\n00:41:34\nI know you're writing a screenplay for [unintelligible]. Will it ever become a film?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:41:39\nWill it ever? Let's see now, I finished it at the end of July. Now, what is--the stages of making a film are these: first somebody takes out an option on it, which means they pay you X dollars to have the sole right to try to make the movie for a certain period of time. If they fail to make it to renew the option or to require the rights at the end of that period, you get it back and you can then sell it to anybody else or back to them if you want. That's different from buying the rights which means they've got it. And you can't get it back. An option has been taken out, a script has been written. They are now doing whatever it is they do, who knows. To try to put together what is called a package, that is, they try to interest a director or they pick out a director and they try to put a director together with a script together with some money. And that's all going on, I don't know what's happening with it because they don't tell. Yes.\n \nAudience Member 4\n00:42:42\nAre those people American or Canadian?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:42:47\nThese people are. [Audience laughter]. Once upon a time there was an English Canadian film industry. Not very hard. I mean it's trying very hard but not many results are being had. And I wanted very much to make Surfacing in Canada with Canadian everything, but I was about two years too late. And also Canadians are quite timmerus about this book because they said \u201cwell, it'll never be able to sell a film in the States\u201d because of all that strange American symbolism in it. They--the two people I'm working with are two American independent producers, not to be confused with MGM [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q179200], who want to make the book as it is, that is, they like the book, they want to be faithful to it, they don't want to transport it to Maine [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q724] or wherever and make it into an American film, which of course you couldn't do without ruining the symbolic pattern. They want to make it in Canada, they want to put in all that stuff because they say \u201cwow, dynamite\u201d. [Audience laughter]. They're not worried about selling it in the States. So that's how we're proceeding right now and we have not yet had a falling out on any of the crucial matters such as what's in the screenplay. And so that's been fine. They would like to make it here. And what stage they're at right now I don't know. Now if they don't put it together, then I get it back and then I have another go. And I'll try it \u2018round Canada again, once more, and I'll probably with the same results--\n \nAudience Member 4\n00:44:26\nYou have tried?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:44:30\nOh yes, everybody tries. I've written four or five screenplays, none of them have been made. They've all been for Canadians. One thing has happened, I got one television play done, but of course everything you do for the CBC [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q461761] pretty well gets done. [Audience laughter]. As you know. I wrote a screenplay for Edible Woman that didn't get done. I wrote one for Marie-Claire Blais [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q298358], Mad Shadows, we had high hopes for that, that was a Canadian director, Canadian producer all the rest of it. No deal. Film development corporations said it wasn't commercial enough. I mean, you don't go outside before you've been through it for a while. It's a problem that novelists used to face when trying to get their novels published here.\n \nWynne Francis\n00:45:22\nI'd like to ask a question, and I can't see what competition I've got, I can't see anything out there. On Wednesday at Loyola, you gave comic tags to some of your critical opponents taken from Koestler [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q78494], Yogis and Komisars are critics that are formalists and culturally and politically aware and I wondered, do you see the ideal critic or type of criticism as combining these two?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:45:51\nWell, I think that people have certain talents, you know, and they should exercise what talents they have, and that all kinds of criticism should be available to the reader. I don't think that every critic has to do everything, I think that would be asking a singer to be a dancer. \n \nWynne Francis\n00:46:08\nI remember you saying it was good to have both kinds, I wondered if you think they could be combined?\n \nAudience Member 5\n00:46:16\nIs it possible that the body of knowledge turns into the knowing body?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:46:20\nIs it possible that the body of knowledge turns into the knowing body? Um, I'll let you answer that. If such a person could do it, I'd like to see it, I've never seen anybody who could do both at the same time. Frye [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q354256], for instance, does one kind in one book and then another kind in another book, but he usually doesn't usually do them both in the same book. I would say that Yogi-ism is necessary to be able to read a poem, just period pure and simple. To see what is happening in it. But Komasarism is necessary to place it in a larger context. Why not do both? Yes, I see. Back there, you\n \nAudience Member 6\n00:47:08\nDo you think that Quebec [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q176] is a part of Canada?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:47:09\nOh that's such a good question.\n \nAudience Member 6\n00:47:11\nDo you think that a Quebecois is a Canadian?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:47:15\nI think I'll leave that to the Quebecois to decide for themselves. They're the people concerned. [Audience applause]. I was talking with one not so long ago, Marie-Claire Blais, and I asked her that question. I said, \u201cwell, what do you think of yourself as? Do you think of yourself as a Quebecoise? or a Canadian? or a North-American, or part of Western European culture or a universalist?\u201d And she said, \u201cI am from Quebec\u201d. [Audience laughter]. Does that answer your question? Yes.\n \nAudience Member  7\n00:47:58\nWhat is your opinion of the introductions in the New Canadian Library [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16998703] Series?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:48:03\nWell, they vary. [Audience laughter]. Do you mean the one? Well, I thought that it was, it was like a, well, the only thing I can think of is something fairly vulgar, um, but I don't mean that I think it was bad. I mean that I think it was quite a ponderous organization, being brought to bear on what I consider to be a fairly light piece of writing. That is, at the front of my book, I have a quotation from the Joy of Cooking which tells how to make puff pastry. And then I have you know, critical sort of, really big critical apparatus coming in and talking about the symbolic structuring and the this and the that, and I think it's nice, I'm glad to know about those things, but [audience laughter] it's somehow, I thought my novel was a bit more comic than that. If you know what I mean.\n \nAudience Member 8\n00:49:09\nYeah, I wanted to ask a question. Yeah, I was wondering to what degree you consider yourself to be an ironist because you're talking about [unintelligible] irony, it seems to me that irony is the point I\u2019m most attracted to in your work anyway.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:49:22\nYeah, well, you can have both of course, as a matter of fact you usually do.\n \nAudience Member 8\n00:49:31\nYou were talking about anger, and \"permit me the present tense\" kind of thing, seems to me that that was ironic.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:49:41\nAmbigu--it has a double meaning. But that's not always irony, I think irony has been...Well, somebody defined irony as a kind of literature in which the reader knows more about what's going on with the character than the character knows himself, shall we say. So, yes, of course, I think that happens in an awful lot of modern literature. Yes.\n \nAudience Member 9\n00:50:14\nI understand you're working on Survival Two?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:50:16\nNot working, exactly.\n \nAudience Member 9\n00:50:22\nI was wondering whether you could, or would like to elaborate on that.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:50:25\nYeah, okay. There was to have been something called Survival Two, which was to have been this really dynamite anthology. Which would have incorporated many of the short pieces mentioned in Survival, plus other ones that were appropriate and we did assemble this and then we had it priced as to how much it would cost for permissions and how much it would cost us to print it and it was just astronomically expensive. So we had to shelf that, and that was what Survival Two was to have been. Now I'll probably publish the proposed table of contents sometime and you can see what would have been in it. [Audience laughter]. You know, but a small publisher cannot afford to do this kind of thing. However, I am, I won't say working on because I'm working on it in the same sense that I'm working on my Ph.D. thesis, what I'm really doing is writing a novel. But I will, should I live that long, write a second edition of Survival, in which I hope to have five new chapters and additions to the ones that already exist. I think the thing about Survival that sometimes gets forgotten was that it was based on what was available in paperback at the time. A lot more things are available in paperback now, we have General Publishing coming on the scene, with Paper Jacks,  and New Canadian Library expanding itself and Macmillan's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2108217] paperbacks expanding. So there's just a lot more around that you can put in and also new books have been published that I would like to talk about and I've discovered older ones that I didn't know about before. So, all of these things, plus a new introduction and maybe a few things at the back, I would like to do. However, I'm not quite ready to do it yet. I took a kind of holiday after I finished Survival One, and I'm still in that, it's a holiday devoted to writing other things. Yes,\n \nAudience Member 10\n00:52:30\nWho are your favourite poets?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:52:33\nI tend to have favourite poems, rather than favourite poets, but I can tell you the names of some people who've written some of my favourite poems. One of them is Margaret Avison [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6759152], one of them is P.K. Page [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2755960], they're poems by all kinds of people that I really like, for instance, I really like some of A.M. Klein's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2778027] poems. I think they're just super. And more modern people, for instance, Michael Ondaatje [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q313593], I like his work, Al Purdy [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4704621] I was reading in the early to middle Sixties, Doug Jones [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5203595] at that time. It covers a very wide range. I'm a kind of omnivorous reader, I'll read anything, including the backs of Cornflake boxes, so that you just never know, and it also changes, you know, because you read somebody for a while and then you've done that so you go and read somebody else.\n\nAudience Member 10\n00:53:31\n[Unintelligible].\n\nMargaret Atwood\n00:53:33\nOh yeah, I get various little magazines come floating in through the mail to me, for some reason. And right now, for instance, I'm reading a lot of Adrienne Rich [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q270705], because I'm about to write a review of her latest book. This kind of thing, I mean it varies from month to month. If you ask me the same question in January the question would be different...Yeah.\n \nAudience Member 11\n00:54:02\n[Unintelligible] Is Surfacing more than vaguely autobiographical?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:54:11\nIt's vaguely, if you're talking about the plot--no. The setting, yes, and this is generally true of fiction, that people write from a setting that they know. They generally create characters out of some people that they've known plus they throw things in and invent them and make mosaics out of various things and the characters are fictional. The plot is usually a total invention. I mean, my parents are still alive and well, all of that. No, I have never been a paranoid schizophrenic with amnesia. [Audience laughter]. And as for the Edible Woman, I've never gone off food, but all kinds of other people have. You know, they come up to me and say, \u201cGee, how did you know the story of my life\u201d and \u201cthat's happened to me and let me tell you it was awful, I used to throw up on busses\u201d. I was kind of shocked, actually, I thought it was all a big comic invention of my own. I see one waving at the back.\n \nAudience Member 12\n00:55:20\nUm, excuse me, would you say that you base your characters on some type of psychological background?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:55:25\nUm, I try to make them believable insofar as it will fit the plot. That is, I try to make what they do believable to myself, but they have to do what they do if you see what I mean. Yes.\n \nAudience Member 13\n00:55:46\nWould you say the Edible Woman is a comical invention of your own?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:55:49\nI said I thought it was, yeah.\n \nAudience Member 13\n00:55:51\nWell, how would you define that, as a comedy?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:55:54\nOh, okay, if you wanna be technical. Um, the Edible Woman is actually an anti-comedy. Because a comedy is a form in which usually a young couple goes through a series of misadventures and blokings and gets married at the end. Now in the Edible Woman, a young couple goes through a series of misadventures and blokings and somebody else gets married at the end. [Audience laughter]. Yes. \n \nAudience Member 14\n00:56:24\nCould you tell us anything about the novel you're writing now?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:56:26\nNot a thing, that's my one superstition--well, it's one of my superstitions. I can't talk about work that I'm doing, it uses up the energy. It's true. Yeah.\n \nAudience Member 15\n00:56:41\nI read the Edible Woman right after reading a book by Robertson Davies [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q545375], about [unintelligible].\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:56:49\nOkay, the question is I read the Edible Woman right after reading a book by Robertson Davies, Fifth Business [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5447489]?\n \nAudience Member 15\n00:56:58\nNo, an earlier book.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:57:00\nManticore [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7750230]?\n \nAudience Member 15\n00:57:00\nIt was a comedy\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:57:01\nOh, okay.\n \nAudience Member 15\n00:57:02\nAbout a couple in a town [unintelligible] resolve it and they get married. And I wondered why he wasn't mentioned in Survival at all.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:57:15\nWell, I think probably because I wasn't doing humour and I wasn't doing magic. But since I am doing humour and magic in the next two chapters, then he will be in those. Samuel Marchbanks [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7412104] will be in under humour and Fifth Business and Manticore will be in under magic. I find the magician figure in Fifth Business very interesting from this particular advantage point. Why do Canadian magicians have to disguise themselves as foreigners in order to be thought of as magic. [Audience laughter.] You find this in Gwen MacEwen [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4276487] too. Specifically in the book called No Man.\n \nAudience Member 16\n00:58:04\nIs that a novel?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:58:04\nIt is a series of short stories, but there's sort of a central one in which you have the same pattern. Okay, let's have one more if there is one more. There isn't one more, there's one more.\n \nAudience Member 17\n00:58:22\nUm, the poems that you read tonight, would you consider those the best or the most significant ones from your collection, and if neither of those things, why did you select the ones that you read? The reason that I've asked that is because I've read your latest book quite carefully and I think that you read the, some of the best poems from it. I was wondering if you thought they were some of the best poems.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:58:45\nYeah. I think that one of the best things in it is section number three, but that consists of twenty four poems, which seem to me to be too long. I read some of them that I like quite a lot, yes, this is true, but I left out some others that I also like quite a lot because it seemed to me that they were too long and at this particular night anyway I felt that I should get through as quickly as possible because we were all stifling to death. Um, and with that I think that I will now end the question period and we can all go out and have a drink of water. \n\nAudience\n00:59:24\nApplause [cuts out briefly].\n \nWynne Francis\n00:59:38\nI'd just like to thank Margaret Atwood very much for being with us tonight--\n\nAudience\n00:59:40\nLaughter.\n \nEND\n00:59:46\n"

                "notes": "Internationally acclaimed novelist, poet, critic and activist Margaret Atwood was born in Ottawa, Ontario, November 18, 1939. She lived in Ottawa until 1946, when her family settled in Leaside, a suburb of Toronto. Atwood entered Victoria College, University of Toronto, graduating with honours in 1961. Her first published collection of short stories was Double Persephone (Hawkshead Press, 1961). By 1962 she had received her MA in English from Radcliffe College in the United States, working on further graduate work at Harvard University between 1962-3 and in 1965-7. Atwood published her second collection, The Circle Game (Anansi, 1966), which won the Governor General Award for Poetry. She wrote articles and reviews for Alphabet, Canadian Literature and Poetry among other publications, and poems for Kayak, Quarry and the Tamarack Review. Poems published in her book The Animals in That Country (Oxford University Press, 1968) won first prize in Canada\u2019s 1967 Centennial Commission poetry competition. In 1970, she published three books, Procedures for Underground (Oxford University Press), Time, and The Journals of Susanna Moodie (Oxford University Press). Between 1971 and 1973, Atwood worked as an editor and on the board of directors for the House of Anansi press in Toronto, which in 1972 published Power Politics. Upon the discovery at Harvard that there was no published critical study of Canadian literature, she herself wrote and published Survival: A Thematic Guide to Canadian Literature (Anansi, 1971), which created a stir of controversy, but by 1982 it had sold more than 85,000 copies. Since 1973, she has lived with novelist and activist Graeme Gibson, producing one daughter, Eleanor Jess in 1967. Atwood taught and lectured at several Universities across Canada, the US and Australia, including University of British Columbia, University of Alberta, Sir George Williams University (now Concordia) (1967-68) and at York University, Toronto. A selection of her publications include Surfacing (Simon & Schuster, 1972), You Are Happy (Harper & Row, 1974), Selected Poems (Oxford University Press) in 1976, Two-Headed Poems (Simon & Schuster, 1978), True Stories (Oxford University Press, 1981) and Second Words (Anansi, 1982). Her 1985 novel, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale (McClelland & Stewart) became one of her most popular and critically acclaimed works. In 1986 she was appointed the Berg Chair at New York University, as well as serving as writer-in-residence at several other Universities. She co-founded and served as chair to the Writer\u2019s Union of Canada in 1982-3, and served as president of the Canadian Centre of International PEN from 1984-6. She has subsequently published dozens of books, including Cat\u2019s Eye (McClelland & Stewart, 1988), The Robber Bride (Doubleday, 1993), Alias Grace (Nan A. Talese, 1996), The Blind Assassin (Nan A. Talese, 2000), Oryx and Crake (2003), The Penelopiad (Canongate, 2005) and The Tent (Bloomsbury, 2006). Along with many other publications of her critical essays, Curious Pursuits: Occasional Writing 1970-2005 (Verago) came out in 2005. Her many prizes and honours include the Booker Prize, the E.J. Pratt Medal (1961), The Radcliffe Medal (1980), the Commonwealth Writers Prize (1992), and she is a Companion of the Order of Canada. Atwood continues to work as spokesperson on behalf of human rights and the environment."

                "contents": "margaret_atwood_i006-11-008.mp3\n\nHenry Beissel\n00:00:00\nOne moment... problem that we have here at Sir George [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q326342]. We did try to get a larger hall but it was impossible. To accommodate the overflow, we have set up loudspeakers in the little gallery here, Howard, and in the other one too?\n \nHoward Fink\n00:00:21\nOutside.\n \nHenry Beissel\n00:00:22\nOutside, there are loudspeakers. So please don't all crowd into the room. If you are going to lean against the paintings, we shall never be able to get this room again for poetry readings. Because this, this is a gallery which belongs to the Fine Arts department, we had great difficulty getting it, these paintings are very precious, particularly to the artists themselves [audience laughter]. I would ask you please to stay away from the paintings. That must have been the artist [audience laughter]. We are also waiting for the arrival of someone else, so please be patient. Howard--[audience laughter] can you ask the security people to turn on the cooling system, the hall is going to be too hot.\n \nUnknown\n00:01:22\nAmbient Sound [voices].\n \nHenry Beissel\n00:01:25\nWe may get 927.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:01:30\nWhat do you mean, we may, I think they're also--okay. What would you like to do? Let us stay here or move?\n \nAudience\n00:01:41\nStay here.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:01:44\nOkay, with the people, there are some people who are at the back of the door, there is some space up here at the front if you'd like to come up.\n \nHenry Beissel\n00:01:54\nNo more than ten.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:01:58\nAbout ten. It'll make more room at the back too...If everybody on the chairs would shift over this way, um, and sit on, sort of as if it were a bench, then some more people can sit on the edges there. Or just move the chairs all that way. Move the rows forward. They're all shifting over anyway. Could you all move your chairs forward to make the rows as close together as possible. Okay, it's alright. \n\nUnknown\n00:03:17\nAmbient Sound [voices].\n\nMargaret Atwood\n00:04:41\nThere are these uhh--woohoo--there are these speakers outside and you might be more comfortable if you went out and listened over the speakers, some of the people are really jammed in there. I don't see any reason why this thing should resemble a steam bath, for all of us. If you're--what? what?...I don't think I can, what is it that they do? [Audience laughter].\n \nWynne Francis\n00:05:19\n[Laughter]. Miss Atwood [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q183492] has just upstaged the introducer. Good evening ladies and gentlemen. It's not often that an artist excels in two medium such as poetry and fiction as our guest tonight does. Miss Atwood's reputation as a superior poet was established in the 60's with her first collections, The Circle Game [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7723073] and The Animals in that Country [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7713834]. And while continuing to write fine poetry, six major collections to date, she's given  us two novels in the last five years, The Edible Woman [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7731579] and Surfacing. With the second novel, published late in 1972, within a few months of a controversial work of criticism, Margaret Atwood became one of Canada's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16] best known literary artists. The hypothesis of Survival, a study of patterns in Canadian lit is that Canadians see themselves as victims. I was remind of Survival recently when I came across a nineteenth-century curiosity written by one John McTaggart [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q463553]. It was a book published in London [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q84] in 19-- excuse me--1829. McTaggart wrote \"There's a melancholy which is peculiar to Canadians which must be combatted. People who labor under it must be encouraged, the soothing language, good treatment and now and then as circumstances require, a little assistance gratis as a stimulant.\" McTaggart's third point about the helpful effects of a little assistance as a recent theory has been taken up by the Canada Council [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2993809], to whom we are in part indebted for her appearance tonight. Margaret Atwood's work constitutes an exploration of what it means to be a Canadian, to be a woman and to be a human being. She writes about our totems, our tapestry of manners, our progressive insanities. She taught at Sir George in 67-68, and it's a great pleasure to have her return to us tonight. After her reading, she'll be open to questions from the audience. Ladies and gentlemen, Margaret Atwood.\n\nAudience\n00:07:27\nApplause [cuts out briefly].\n\nMargaret Atwood\n00:07:38\nLet's see now, if the mic starts to get funny, let me know...Too loud?...Not too loud, I'm afraid it isn't a very good mic and also I'm afraid I'm going to have to hold it the whole time which is a bore...I don't think it'll work very well, is that better? Does that work? Higher? Lower? Okay, how's that? Okay, I'm going to read entirely from my new book which is called \"This is\"--oh, what is it called? [audience laughter]. It's called You Are Happy. Somebody who has been photographing me says that a friend of hers was in a bookstore and picked out this book and thought at first that this was one of these \"I'm Okay, You're Okay\" books. Until I saw who wrote it. [Audience laughter]. But it has a happy ending, you'll be pleased to know. And I'm going to begin at the beginning and end at the end. Skipping portions along the way. I'm also going to make this reading fairly short because we are all in this rather constricted situation. I used to tell people when people in the States [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30] used to ask me \u201cdo you live in an igloo\u201d and other questions like that, I used to think to myself that being a Canadian was sort of like living in a chicken coop in the middle of the desert. That everybody was all together in one place but there are these huge spaces around. I wish that  we had been provided with one of them. [Audience laughter]. I have a chicken coop, and you're nicer. But there are more of you. I think we will all have to be very, very patient, unlike the chickens. I'm going to begin by reading a poem called \"Newsreel: Man and Firing Squad\".\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:10:04\nReads \"Newsreel: Man and Firing Squad\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:11:42\nReads \"Useless\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:12:35\nThis is--the image in this next poem comes from, begins with the fact that I have a sheep and one of them died. The poem is called \"November\".\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:12:48\nReads \"November\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:13:52\nReads \"Repent\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:14:47\n\"Tricks with Mirrors\". How are you doing? Is it hot and steamy? Has anybody died yet?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:15:05\nReads \"Tricks with Mirrors\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:17:45\nThis is the title poem, \"You Are Happy\".\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:17:50\nReads \"You are Happy\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:18:48\nReads \"First Prayer\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:20:25\n\"Is \/ Not: 1\". Oh boy, is it ever hot in here. I can't stand it. Light. I wonder if we could--well, then I can't see, you see. I wonder if we could turn off--would it be better if we turn off those lights that are grilling you over there...I could what?...Where's the light switch anyway? Howard, turn off the lights?...Well, maybe in a few minutes the lights will go off. Where did\u2026\n\nUnknown\n00:21:36\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed]. \n\nMargaret Atwood\n00:21:37\nHooray, wonderful. Actually, there's a light under here. It's like the Saturday movies [audience laughter]. No, I can read with this, yeah. Maybe I'll just read a little something else here, because it's the Saturday Movies.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:22:18\nReads [\"You take my hand\" from Power Politics; audience laughter throughout].\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:23:13\nAnd since we were talking about the war between Superman [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q79015] and Captain Marvel [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q534153] at dinner, my favourite was Plastic Man [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q746838], but that was an esoteric taste. I'll read this one.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:23:28\nReads \"They Eat Out\" [from Power Politics].\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:24:44\nI go to--I can't resist this. This is from the new book, it's called \"Siren Song\". Students of Seventeenth Century Literature are always asking themselves and each other, what song the sirens sang, and this is the ultimate answer.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:25:06\nReads \"Siren Song\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:26:12\nThe imminent critic, Allen Pearson, who was once known when he lived in Montreal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q340] as the Montreal Poet, now that he lives in Toronto [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q172], he's probably known as the Toronto Poet, says the following: \"Siren Song tells how boring it is for a woman to be obliged to attract men by appealing to them for help\". [Audience laughter]. Um, since I'm on the subject of people in capes and costumes, I'll read...\n \nUnknown\n00:26:56\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n\nAnnotation\n00:26:57\nReads [untitled poem from the \u201cCircle\/Mud Poems\u201d section in You Are Happy].\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:28:20\nReads \"Is \/ Not\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:30:37\nI think I'd better read just three more poems, before we all die. The first one is called \"There is Only One of Everything\".\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:30:54\nReads \"There is Only One of Everything\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:32:30\nReads \"Late August\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:33:26\nThis is the last poem, called \"Book of Ancestors\".\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:33:33\nReads \"Book of Ancestors\" from You Are Happy. \n \nAudience\n00:36:31\nApplause [cuts out briefly].\n\nWynne Francis\n00:36:47\nThank you, it's really not so hot if you sit still. Miss Atwood is prepared to discuss, for a little while.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:37:04\nIf you would like to, uh, I can't see a thing of course, I can sort of see hands if you stick them up and wave them around. Would that be better than turning back on the lights which I'd prefer not to do?\n \nWynne Francis\n00:37:22\nThere's no way we can get mics in the audience, so please speak loudly.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:37:23\nI see a hand.\n \nAudience Member 1\n00:37:28\nHow did your nickname of a witch get originated?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:37:30\nHow did my nickname of a witch? Are you referring to the speech I gave the other night at Loyola? Oh, it's, I was talking about a couple of reviews, that seemed to credit me with having these supernatural powers, you know, the ability to hypnotize my readers and things like that, and what I was saying was that in fact I don't in fact possess the powers of hypnotism or I'd use them on my bank manager and be quite rich. Um, I was talking about a pattern that seems to crop up from time to time in a certain kind of review usually written by men. [Audience laughter]. I heard that there were a couple of people in the audience at Loyola who before the speech, were convinced that I was a witch and that I was going to talk about witchcraft, and when I said that I wasn't one, they left. [Audience laughter]. You see, if I were a witch, I wouldn't be able to wear the cross. So that's how you can tell I'm not. Wards off vampires. Um, yes?\n \nAudience Member 2\n00:38:54\nUm, [unintelligible] and as well as the Edible Woman, I seem to get this idea of an emergence from greyness, or darkness and I was wondering if it's through this emergence from greyness that you have any reference to Blake [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q41513] in his emergence from chaos.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:39:17\nI'll be very flattered, if I did. I'm afraid I suffer by the comparison. I think that you're right in spotting it, I think I would say that it's more like this, that if you want to think in terms of colour, that you start with a grey, and then you go down. Down into, well, it depends on the poem or the book or whatever of what's happening in your life. And, but you have to go down before you come up again otherwise you stay just in the grey part. If you want a real pattern for this, it's Dante's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1067] Inferno [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4509219], where the man starts in a wandering wood, you know he starts in a kind of state of being lost, and then he goes down into hell. The further down he goes the more tortured souls he sees, but when he gets right to the bottom he finds that he's going up again. And then he comes out the other side.\n \nAudience Member 2\n00:40:19\nYeah, but, in this other side-ness in the Edible Woman you come up through colours, a very [unintelligible] of colours and I was wondering if this is the complete emergence of man?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:40:29\nNot complete--I would say no, no beginning.\n \nAudience Member 2\n00:40:32\n[Unintelligible] complete--into his universal aspect, but into an emergence of man. Into the colours of life.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:40:39\nYour choice of the word 'man' is interesting. Since the heroine is a woman. [Audience laughter and applause]. Um, I think you have the pattern right. I wouldn't like to attach any sort of universal meaning to it.\n \nAudience Member 2\n00:40:56\nNo I'm not attaching a universal meaning, I'm attaching more or less a universal meaning to the colour of darkness or greyness.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:41:04\nNo, that's right, you're correct. Yes.\n \nAudience Member 2\n00:41:07\nI'm not trying to express a universal meaning into these colours, this is where you're taking it wrong.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:41:14\nWell, I'm not too sure what we're talking about  to tell you the truth. You've spotted a correct pattern and I'm not too sure how one interprets it because I don't like to be the critic of  my own work in a way if you know what I mean. Yes.\n \nAudience Member 3\n00:41:34\nI know you're writing a screenplay for [unintelligible]. Will it ever become a film?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:41:39\nWill it ever? Let's see now, I finished it at the end of July. Now, what is--the stages of making a film are these: first somebody takes out an option on it, which means they pay you X dollars to have the sole right to try to make the movie for a certain period of time. If they fail to make it to renew the option or to require the rights at the end of that period, you get it back and you can then sell it to anybody else or back to them if you want. That's different from buying the rights which means they've got it. And you can't get it back. An option has been taken out, a script has been written. They are now doing whatever it is they do, who knows. To try to put together what is called a package, that is, they try to interest a director or they pick out a director and they try to put a director together with a script together with some money. And that's all going on, I don't know what's happening with it because they don't tell. Yes.\n \nAudience Member 4\n00:42:42\nAre those people American or Canadian?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:42:47\nThese people are. [Audience laughter]. Once upon a time there was an English Canadian film industry. Not very hard. I mean it's trying very hard but not many results are being had. And I wanted very much to make Surfacing in Canada with Canadian everything, but I was about two years too late. And also Canadians are quite timmerus about this book because they said \u201cwell, it'll never be able to sell a film in the States\u201d because of all that strange American symbolism in it. They--the two people I'm working with are two American independent producers, not to be confused with MGM [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q179200], who want to make the book as it is, that is, they like the book, they want to be faithful to it, they don't want to transport it to Maine [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q724] or wherever and make it into an American film, which of course you couldn't do without ruining the symbolic pattern. They want to make it in Canada, they want to put in all that stuff because they say \u201cwow, dynamite\u201d. [Audience laughter]. They're not worried about selling it in the States. So that's how we're proceeding right now and we have not yet had a falling out on any of the crucial matters such as what's in the screenplay. And so that's been fine. They would like to make it here. And what stage they're at right now I don't know. Now if they don't put it together, then I get it back and then I have another go. And I'll try it \u2018round Canada again, once more, and I'll probably with the same results--\n \nAudience Member 4\n00:44:26\nYou have tried?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:44:30\nOh yes, everybody tries. I've written four or five screenplays, none of them have been made. They've all been for Canadians. One thing has happened, I got one television play done, but of course everything you do for the CBC [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q461761] pretty well gets done. [Audience laughter]. As you know. I wrote a screenplay for Edible Woman that didn't get done. I wrote one for Marie-Claire Blais [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q298358], Mad Shadows, we had high hopes for that, that was a Canadian director, Canadian producer all the rest of it. No deal. Film development corporations said it wasn't commercial enough. I mean, you don't go outside before you've been through it for a while. It's a problem that novelists used to face when trying to get their novels published here.\n \nWynne Francis\n00:45:22\nI'd like to ask a question, and I can't see what competition I've got, I can't see anything out there. On Wednesday at Loyola, you gave comic tags to some of your critical opponents taken from Koestler [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q78494], Yogis and Komisars are critics that are formalists and culturally and politically aware and I wondered, do you see the ideal critic or type of criticism as combining these two?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:45:51\nWell, I think that people have certain talents, you know, and they should exercise what talents they have, and that all kinds of criticism should be available to the reader. I don't think that every critic has to do everything, I think that would be asking a singer to be a dancer. \n \nWynne Francis\n00:46:08\nI remember you saying it was good to have both kinds, I wondered if you think they could be combined?\n \nAudience Member 5\n00:46:16\nIs it possible that the body of knowledge turns into the knowing body?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:46:20\nIs it possible that the body of knowledge turns into the knowing body? Um, I'll let you answer that. If such a person could do it, I'd like to see it, I've never seen anybody who could do both at the same time. Frye [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q354256], for instance, does one kind in one book and then another kind in another book, but he usually doesn't usually do them both in the same book. I would say that Yogi-ism is necessary to be able to read a poem, just period pure and simple. To see what is happening in it. But Komasarism is necessary to place it in a larger context. Why not do both? Yes, I see. Back there, you\n \nAudience Member 6\n00:47:08\nDo you think that Quebec [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q176] is a part of Canada?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:47:09\nOh that's such a good question.\n \nAudience Member 6\n00:47:11\nDo you think that a Quebecois is a Canadian?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:47:15\nI think I'll leave that to the Quebecois to decide for themselves. They're the people concerned. [Audience applause]. I was talking with one not so long ago, Marie-Claire Blais, and I asked her that question. I said, \u201cwell, what do you think of yourself as? Do you think of yourself as a Quebecoise? or a Canadian? or a North-American, or part of Western European culture or a universalist?\u201d And she said, \u201cI am from Quebec\u201d. [Audience laughter]. Does that answer your question? Yes.\n \nAudience Member  7\n00:47:58\nWhat is your opinion of the introductions in the New Canadian Library [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16998703] Series?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:48:03\nWell, they vary. [Audience laughter]. Do you mean the one? Well, I thought that it was, it was like a, well, the only thing I can think of is something fairly vulgar, um, but I don't mean that I think it was bad. I mean that I think it was quite a ponderous organization, being brought to bear on what I consider to be a fairly light piece of writing. That is, at the front of my book, I have a quotation from the Joy of Cooking which tells how to make puff pastry. And then I have you know, critical sort of, really big critical apparatus coming in and talking about the symbolic structuring and the this and the that, and I think it's nice, I'm glad to know about those things, but [audience laughter] it's somehow, I thought my novel was a bit more comic than that. If you know what I mean.\n \nAudience Member 8\n00:49:09\nYeah, I wanted to ask a question. Yeah, I was wondering to what degree you consider yourself to be an ironist because you're talking about [unintelligible] irony, it seems to me that irony is the point I\u2019m most attracted to in your work anyway.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:49:22\nYeah, well, you can have both of course, as a matter of fact you usually do.\n \nAudience Member 8\n00:49:31\nYou were talking about anger, and \"permit me the present tense\" kind of thing, seems to me that that was ironic.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:49:41\nAmbigu--it has a double meaning. But that's not always irony, I think irony has been...Well, somebody defined irony as a kind of literature in which the reader knows more about what's going on with the character than the character knows himself, shall we say. So, yes, of course, I think that happens in an awful lot of modern literature. Yes.\n \nAudience Member 9\n00:50:14\nI understand you're working on Survival Two?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:50:16\nNot working, exactly.\n \nAudience Member 9\n00:50:22\nI was wondering whether you could, or would like to elaborate on that.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:50:25\nYeah, okay. There was to have been something called Survival Two, which was to have been this really dynamite anthology. Which would have incorporated many of the short pieces mentioned in Survival, plus other ones that were appropriate and we did assemble this and then we had it priced as to how much it would cost for permissions and how much it would cost us to print it and it was just astronomically expensive. So we had to shelf that, and that was what Survival Two was to have been. Now I'll probably publish the proposed table of contents sometime and you can see what would have been in it. [Audience laughter]. You know, but a small publisher cannot afford to do this kind of thing. However, I am, I won't say working on because I'm working on it in the same sense that I'm working on my Ph.D. thesis, what I'm really doing is writing a novel. But I will, should I live that long, write a second edition of Survival, in which I hope to have five new chapters and additions to the ones that already exist. I think the thing about Survival that sometimes gets forgotten was that it was based on what was available in paperback at the time. A lot more things are available in paperback now, we have General Publishing coming on the scene, with Paper Jacks,  and New Canadian Library expanding itself and Macmillan's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2108217] paperbacks expanding. So there's just a lot more around that you can put in and also new books have been published that I would like to talk about and I've discovered older ones that I didn't know about before. So, all of these things, plus a new introduction and maybe a few things at the back, I would like to do. However, I'm not quite ready to do it yet. I took a kind of holiday after I finished Survival One, and I'm still in that, it's a holiday devoted to writing other things. Yes,\n \nAudience Member 10\n00:52:30\nWho are your favourite poets?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:52:33\nI tend to have favourite poems, rather than favourite poets, but I can tell you the names of some people who've written some of my favourite poems. One of them is Margaret Avison [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6759152], one of them is P.K. Page [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2755960], they're poems by all kinds of people that I really like, for instance, I really like some of A.M. Klein's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2778027] poems. I think they're just super. And more modern people, for instance, Michael Ondaatje [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q313593], I like his work, Al Purdy [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4704621] I was reading in the early to middle Sixties, Doug Jones [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5203595] at that time. It covers a very wide range. I'm a kind of omnivorous reader, I'll read anything, including the backs of Cornflake boxes, so that you just never know, and it also changes, you know, because you read somebody for a while and then you've done that so you go and read somebody else.\n\nAudience Member 10\n00:53:31\n[Unintelligible].\n\nMargaret Atwood\n00:53:33\nOh yeah, I get various little magazines come floating in through the mail to me, for some reason. And right now, for instance, I'm reading a lot of Adrienne Rich [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q270705], because I'm about to write a review of her latest book. This kind of thing, I mean it varies from month to month. If you ask me the same question in January the question would be different...Yeah.\n \nAudience Member 11\n00:54:02\n[Unintelligible] Is Surfacing more than vaguely autobiographical?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:54:11\nIt's vaguely, if you're talking about the plot--no. The setting, yes, and this is generally true of fiction, that people write from a setting that they know. They generally create characters out of some people that they've known plus they throw things in and invent them and make mosaics out of various things and the characters are fictional. The plot is usually a total invention. I mean, my parents are still alive and well, all of that. No, I have never been a paranoid schizophrenic with amnesia. [Audience laughter]. And as for the Edible Woman, I've never gone off food, but all kinds of other people have. You know, they come up to me and say, \u201cGee, how did you know the story of my life\u201d and \u201cthat's happened to me and let me tell you it was awful, I used to throw up on busses\u201d. I was kind of shocked, actually, I thought it was all a big comic invention of my own. I see one waving at the back.\n \nAudience Member 12\n00:55:20\nUm, excuse me, would you say that you base your characters on some type of psychological background?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:55:25\nUm, I try to make them believable insofar as it will fit the plot. That is, I try to make what they do believable to myself, but they have to do what they do if you see what I mean. Yes.\n \nAudience Member 13\n00:55:46\nWould you say the Edible Woman is a comical invention of your own?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:55:49\nI said I thought it was, yeah.\n \nAudience Member 13\n00:55:51\nWell, how would you define that, as a comedy?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:55:54\nOh, okay, if you wanna be technical. Um, the Edible Woman is actually an anti-comedy. Because a comedy is a form in which usually a young couple goes through a series of misadventures and blokings and gets married at the end. Now in the Edible Woman, a young couple goes through a series of misadventures and blokings and somebody else gets married at the end. [Audience laughter]. Yes. \n \nAudience Member 14\n00:56:24\nCould you tell us anything about the novel you're writing now?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:56:26\nNot a thing, that's my one superstition--well, it's one of my superstitions. I can't talk about work that I'm doing, it uses up the energy. It's true. Yeah.\n \nAudience Member 15\n00:56:41\nI read the Edible Woman right after reading a book by Robertson Davies [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q545375], about [unintelligible].\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:56:49\nOkay, the question is I read the Edible Woman right after reading a book by Robertson Davies, Fifth Business [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5447489]?\n \nAudience Member 15\n00:56:58\nNo, an earlier book.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:57:00\nManticore [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7750230]?\n \nAudience Member 15\n00:57:00\nIt was a comedy\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:57:01\nOh, okay.\n \nAudience Member 15\n00:57:02\nAbout a couple in a town [unintelligible] resolve it and they get married. And I wondered why he wasn't mentioned in Survival at all.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:57:15\nWell, I think probably because I wasn't doing humour and I wasn't doing magic. But since I am doing humour and magic in the next two chapters, then he will be in those. Samuel Marchbanks [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7412104] will be in under humour and Fifth Business and Manticore will be in under magic. I find the magician figure in Fifth Business very interesting from this particular advantage point. Why do Canadian magicians have to disguise themselves as foreigners in order to be thought of as magic. [Audience laughter.] You find this in Gwen MacEwen [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4276487] too. Specifically in the book called No Man.\n \nAudience Member 16\n00:58:04\nIs that a novel?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:58:04\nIt is a series of short stories, but there's sort of a central one in which you have the same pattern. Okay, let's have one more if there is one more. There isn't one more, there's one more.\n \nAudience Member 17\n00:58:22\nUm, the poems that you read tonight, would you consider those the best or the most significant ones from your collection, and if neither of those things, why did you select the ones that you read? The reason that I've asked that is because I've read your latest book quite carefully and I think that you read the, some of the best poems from it. I was wondering if you thought they were some of the best poems.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:58:45\nYeah. I think that one of the best things in it is section number three, but that consists of twenty four poems, which seem to me to be too long. I read some of them that I like quite a lot, yes, this is true, but I left out some others that I also like quite a lot because it seemed to me that they were too long and at this particular night anyway I felt that I should get through as quickly as possible because we were all stifling to death. Um, and with that I think that I will now end the question period and we can all go out and have a drink of water. \n\nAudience\n00:59:24\nApplause [cuts out briefly].\n \nWynne Francis\n00:59:38\nI'd just like to thank Margaret Atwood very much for being with us tonight--\n\nAudience\n00:59:40\nLaughter.\n \nEND\n00:59:46\n",

The reader for this evening is Mr. Anthony Hecht [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3618497] of New York City [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60]. Mr. Hecht was born in New York City. He is a fellow of the American Academy in Rome [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q463271]. He is the author of two volumes of poetry, A Summoning of Stones, which was published by Macmillan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2108217] in New York City in 1954, and a later volume published in Northampton, Massachusetts [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q49186] in 1958, Seven Deadly Sins. Mr. Hecht is a poetry editor of The Hudson Review [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q15708605]. Mr. Hecht has also been a faculty member of such universities as Smith [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q49204], New York University [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q49210] and Bard College [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q49109], and he will be joining the faculty of the University of Rochester [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q149990] very soon. Mr. Hecht is the author of three forthcoming volumes: The Hard Hours, which is to be published soon by Viking [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q921536], a volume called Double Dactyls, which is to appear about Christmas and is to be published by Atheneum [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4813415], and a volume of verse epigrams to the engravings of Thomas Bewick [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q437594], which is to be published by the Harvard University Press [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1587900]. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Anthony Hecht. \n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:01:36\nThank you very much. It's a pleasure to be here, this is my first trip to Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16], and I regret that it should be so brief. I must leave tomorrow, but I'm struck by the frigidity of the weather and the warmth of the greeting that I received upon arriving. I'd like to begin with a poem which I'll, is set in Italy [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q38], where I spent quite a while. It's called \"A Hill\", and it's what...about a purported visionary experience. \n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:02:21\nReads \"A Hill\" from The Hard Hours..\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:04:50\nThe next is called \"A Letter\". Some of these, I think, will require some sort of explanatory comment from me, but I don't think this will. \n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:04:59\nReads \"A Letter\" from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:06:44\nThe next is called \"The Vow\". I should say that all the poems that I want to read to you this evening are from a book called The Hard Hours. They...the book is, I fear, for better or for worse, somewhat on the grim side, as the title is meant to indicate. It perhaps is a corrective to the abundant cheerfulness of my first book. But I hope that there were a few light moments here and there. This one, on the other--is somewhat grim. It is in fact about a miscarriage. And I had better explain to you that a large part of the second stanza, and all of the third stanza is spoken by the ghost of the child who fails to be born. It is called \"The Vow\".\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:07:42\nReads \"The Vow\" from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:10:01\nThe next one is also somewhat on the grim side, but it requires an appeasing little note of explanation. Its title is \"More Light! More Light!\" which purport to be the last words of Goethe [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5879] on his deathbed. There's been a good deal of discussion and dispute as to quite what he meant at the time, which may simply have been to raise the shade. But inasmuch as he is regarded as the spirit of the German Enlightenment, a great deal more profound significance is normally attached to those words. He plays a very minor, somewhat ghostly role in this poem, which is a deliberate and violent contrast, so violent, indeed, that the poem was rejected by The New Yorker [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q217305] on the grounds that the contrast was much too violent for their taste. Between an execution, which is in fact a conflation I've made myself of several executions that took place in England [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q21] during the Renaissance [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4692], and an execution that took place in the Buchenwald concentration camp [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q152802] during the Second World War [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q362], and the details of which I got from a book by Eugene Kogan, who was himself a prisoner there for five years and survived, miraculously, and was then flown to England to help draw up the indictments that were used, [coughs], excuse me, at the Nuremberg Trials [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q80130]. Goethe's role, his ghostly role in this, is explained by the fact that most prisoners who were brought to Buchenwald were brought by train, and there was no railroad station there at the camp, so the prisoners were, disembarked at the nearest railroad station, which was Weimar [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3955], and they walked the rest of the way from there. \n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:12:01\nReads \"More Light! More Light!\" from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:14:36\nThe next is a little lighter, gratefully. But it has its gruesome aspects too, as a matter of fact. It is called \"The Man Who Married Magdalen: Variation on a Theme by Louis Simpson\". Louis Simpson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1871997], a fine poet and very old friend of mine. A road poem in one of his early books, called \"The Man Who Married Magdalen\", a fine and delicate poem, in which he imagines that this man who raged and stormed throughout his married life, upon the death of his wife finds it in his heart to forgive her and to acknowledge his abiding love for her. In fact, if I can remember the last stanza, it goes, \"But when he woke, and woke alone, he wept and would deny the loose behaviour of the bone, and the immodest thigh\". I have chosen to make him far less forgiving in my version. He is a very angry man, and the whole poem takes place in a bar where he has been releasing his anger in a bibulous way for some time. His anger is not only personal, however, it's also theological. He is someone who believes in and accepts the ancient dispensation according to which Mary Magdalene [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q63070] had done something which could not, in fact, be so easily forgiven. And he regards the new dispensation as an antinomian heresy which leaves him bewildered and accounts for the rather promiscuous behaviour he finds all around him in the bar. I ought to tell you also that I went on a reading tour of New England [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q18389] a few years ago, and I planned to include this, but when I got to...it has some frankly dirty language in the second stanza, and I decided that it was unbecoming at certain colleges, [audience laughter], but I was assured by a friend of mine on the faculty at Wellesley [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q49205] that the girls there were tough, and they could take it.  [Audience laughter]. He liked it, and he thought I should read it. And indeed, I did. And nobody batted an eye. So, from then on, without compunction at all, I read it everywhere else, and when I got to Mount Hollyhock, [audience laughter], there I had every intention of reading it, but they were not only taping it, as you are here this evening, but they were taping it for radio broadcast, so I felt obliged to warn the Federal Communications Commission [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q128831] [audience laughter] that this was the sort of thing that they would probably have to excise. And after the tour was over, I got a postcard from a friend of mine in that bastion of propriety, Boston [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q100], saying that he had heard the whole broadcast with nothing cut out, so I take it there's absolutely nothing wrong with it now [audience laughter]. It has, in any case, a lofty epigraph from the Book of Jonah [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q178819] [audience laughter], which says, \"Then said the Lord, 'Dost thou well, to be angry?'\u201d\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:17:57\nReads \"The Man Who Married Magdalen: Variation on a Theme by Louis Simpson\" from The Hard Hours [audience laughter throughout].\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:20:26\nA poem of a somewhat different sort, called \"Message from the City\".\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:20:37\nReads \"Message from the City\" from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:23:02\nThe poem I want to read next is also, again, on the somewhat grim side. It is, in fact, incomplete, but it stands altogether, by itself. It's going to be longer, but it is a unit, as it appears, or as I shall read it to you, and it's called, in its present state, \"The Rune\".\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:23:35\nReads \"The Rune\" from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:27:54\nI guess a really violent change of pace is required, and I can provide it. But you are not to be spared as easily as that. There's another sort of wracking one that comes up in a minute. However, I can interject something in between. There's a little sort of period piece, a Restoration comedy song, sort of, called \"The Song of the Flea\". It was written...there were a group of poems that I wrote in collaboration with an artist. We did a bestiary together, and he did a whole bunch of very handsome lithographs of animals, and I wrote a few animal poems, and this is one of them.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:28:45\nReads \"The Song of the Flea\" from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:29:40\nNow this, this next, is quite frankly a stinker, I've got to warn you. It's a very unnerving poem. It's a colloquy; there are two voices, but I'm sure you'll have no difficulty telling them apart. There is one speaker who is a kind of compulsive talker, and he has a very patient and somewhat helpless auditor. The poem is called \"Behold the Lilies of the Field\".\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:30:18\nReads \"Behold the Lilies of the Field\" from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:34:34\nThe next is a blessed relief. It's called \"Jason\", which is the name of my older son, and it's a poem written to celebrate his birth. He was born at the time I was teaching at Smith, and he was born on a Sunday, which has some bearing on the poem, but it conveniently avoided my, disrupting my academic obligations. And it has an epigraph from Doctor Faustus [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q50919], which goes, \"And from America, the Golden Fleece\".\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:35:16\nReads \"Jason\" from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:37:12\nThe next one is also, this is also rather cheery too--well, not really. I told you that I had gone on this New England tour a few years ago, and I began it in Maine [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q724]. Well, I may have been misled [distortion], but I was told at the two or three colleges and universities where I read that Maine was a dry state, and I had so arranged my poems, completely unconsciously, that I had a whole bunch of them that all took place in bars, in bars altogether [audience laughter]. So I had the feeling as I was reading--I couldn't stop, you see, there I was-- after the third poem, I felt that I appeared to be an obsessive alcoholic. [Audience laughter]. This also takes place in a bar. I was born and brought up in New York City, and remember it from the time when Third Avenue had an elevator train that ran down its length. Now, that has all been torn down. But in the old days, not only did it have the elevator train, but it was lined on both sides all the way up and down with bars. The bars are still there. But the advantage of the El was that it cast a nice, gloomy shadow over the whole avenue even on the brightest days, so that you weren't obliged to face utter reality as soon as you stepped outside [audience laughter]. There was a sort of modulating gloom that you got out into. Now that's been torn down, and it's tougher than it was. The poem is called \"Third Avenue in Sunlight\".\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:38:45\nReads \"Third Avenue in Sunlight\" from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:40:31\nThere are two more poems I should like to read. The first of these is called \"Birdwatchers of America\". It has an epigraph from the journals of Baudelaire [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q501], very near the end of his life. Baudelaire wrote as follows: \"I suffer now continually from vertigo, and today, the 23rd of January, 1862, I received a singular warning. I felt the wind of the wing of madness pass over me\".\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:41:14\nReads \"Birdwatchers of America\" from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:42:50\nThis is called \"The End of the Weekend\".\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:42:56\nReads \"The End of the Weekend\" from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:44:38\nFinally, there is a poem that I must remind you of which I enormously admire, by Matthew Arnold [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q271032]. \"Dover Beach\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5302469]. I have, in spite of my admiration for it, ventured to write a somewhat impertinent commentary upon it, which is called \"The Dover Bitch\" and subtitled [audience laughter], \"A Criticism of Life\", which is what Arnold said poetry ought to be. \n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:45:13\nReads \"The Dover Bitch: A Criticism of Life\" from The Hard Hours [audience laughter throughout].\n \nEND\n00:46:55\n[Cut off abruptly]."

                "notes": "American poet Anthony Hecht was born in New York City on January 16th, 1923. Hecht has admitted that it was only in his freshman year at Bard College that he became interested in poetry. Upon graduating from Bard in 1944, he was drafted into the United States Army and served in Western Europe and Japan. Hecht was especially impacted by the release of Jews in the concentration camps, a subject that is echoed throughout his poetry. On his return, Hecht was convinced to study with John Crowe Ransom at Kenyon College, and Ransom became a major influence in Hecht\u2019s poetic and intellectual formation. Hecht\u2019s poetry was first published in magazines like the Hudson Review, the Kenyon Review and the New Yorker, and in 1950 he won the Prix de Rome bestowed by the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Hecht\u2019s first book, A Summoning of Stones (MacMillan, 1954) was published, along with a limited edition pamphlet named The Seven Deadly Sins (Gehenna Press, 1954). Hecht then taught at Smith College in Northampton from 1956 to 1959, and then at Bard College from 1961 until 1967. It was at this point that Hecht began to travel on reading tours of his poetry. His next publication, Jiggery Pokery: A Compendium of Double Dactyls (Atheneum, 1966), with John Hollander and Milton Glaser, compiled a new light verse form called \u2018double-dactyl\u2019, which they had invented. A year later, Hecht released his second collection of verse, The Hard Hours (Atheneum, 1967), and took a position at the University of Rochester. In the next few years, Hecht translated Aeschylus\u2019 tragedy of war, Seven Against Thebes (Oxford University Press, 1973) with Helen Bacon. He was also the visiting professor at Washington University (1971), Harvard (1973), and at Yale (1977). Hecht then published collections of poetry, Millions of Strange Shadows (Atheneum, 1977) and The Venetian Vespers (Atheneum, 1979), a collection of criticism, Obbligati (Atheneum, 1986), The Transparent Man (Knopf, 1990) and Flight Among the Tombs (Knopf, 1990). Hecht retired in the early 1990s from his post at Rochester, but remained active and published Hidden Law (1993), a book-length study of Auden\u2019s poetry, and provided the introduction to \u201cThe New Cambridge Shakespeare Sonnets\u201d in 1996. Hecht was the first American poet to be invited to lecture at the Mellon Lectures at the National Gallery of Art in 1992. Hecht published his last collection of poetry, The Darkness and the Light (Knopf) in 2001. Anthony Hecht died of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma on October 20, 2004."

Mr. Hecht is the author of three forthcoming volumes: The Hard Hours, which is to be published soon by Viking [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q921536], a volume called Double Dactyls, which is to appear about Christmas and is to be published by Atheneum [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4813415], and a volume of verse epigrams to the engravings of Thomas Bewick [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q437594], which is to be published by the Harvard University Press [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1587900]. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Anthony Hecht. \n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:01:36\nThank you very much. It's a pleasure to be here, this is my first trip to Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16], and I regret that it should be so brief. I must leave tomorrow, but I'm struck by the frigidity of the weather and the warmth of the greeting that I received upon arriving. I'd like to begin with a poem which I'll, is set in Italy [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q38], where I spent quite a while. It's called \"A Hill\", and it's what...about a purported visionary experience. \n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:02:21\nReads \"A Hill\" from The Hard Hours..\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:04:50\nThe next is called \"A Letter\". Some of these, I think, will require some sort of explanatory comment from me, but I don't think this will. \n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:04:59\nReads \"A Letter\" from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:06:44\nThe next is called \"The Vow\". I should say that all the poems that I want to read to you this evening are from a book called The Hard Hours. They...the book is, I fear, for better or for worse, somewhat on the grim side, as the title is meant to indicate. It perhaps is a corrective to the abundant cheerfulness of my first book. But I hope that there were a few light moments here and there. This one, on the other--is somewhat grim. It is in fact about a miscarriage. And I had better explain to you that a large part of the second stanza, and all of the third stanza is spoken by the ghost of the child who fails to be born. It is called \"The Vow\".\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:07:42\nReads \"The Vow\" from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:10:01\nThe next one is also somewhat on the grim side, but it requires an appeasing little note of explanation. Its title is \"More Light! More Light!\" which purport to be the last words of Goethe [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5879] on his deathbed. There's been a good deal of discussion and dispute as to quite what he meant at the time, which may simply have been to raise the shade. But inasmuch as he is regarded as the spirit of the German Enlightenment, a great deal more profound significance is normally attached to those words. He plays a very minor, somewhat ghostly role in this poem, which is a deliberate and violent contrast, so violent, indeed, that the poem was rejected by The New Yorker [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q217305] on the grounds that the contrast was much too violent for their taste. Between an execution, which is in fact a conflation I've made myself of several executions that took place in England [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q21] during the Renaissance [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4692], and an execution that took place in the Buchenwald concentration camp [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q152802] during the Second World War [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q362], and the details of which I got from a book by Eugene Kogan, who was himself a prisoner there for five years and survived, miraculously, and was then flown to England to help draw up the indictments that were used, [coughs], excuse me, at the Nuremberg Trials [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q80130]. Goethe's role, his ghostly role in this, is explained by the fact that most prisoners who were brought to Buchenwald were brought by train, and there was no railroad station there at the camp, so the prisoners were, disembarked at the nearest railroad station, which was Weimar [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3955], and they walked the rest of the way from there. \n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:12:01\nReads \"More Light! More Light!\" from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:14:36\nThe next is a little lighter, gratefully. But it has its gruesome aspects too, as a matter of fact. It is called \"The Man Who Married Magdalen: Variation on a Theme by Louis Simpson\". Louis Simpson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1871997], a fine poet and very old friend of mine. A road poem in one of his early books, called \"The Man Who Married Magdalen\", a fine and delicate poem, in which he imagines that this man who raged and stormed throughout his married life, upon the death of his wife finds it in his heart to forgive her and to acknowledge his abiding love for her. In fact, if I can remember the last stanza, it goes, \"But when he woke, and woke alone, he wept and would deny the loose behaviour of the bone, and the immodest thigh\". I have chosen to make him far less forgiving in my version. He is a very angry man, and the whole poem takes place in a bar where he has been releasing his anger in a bibulous way for some time. His anger is not only personal, however, it's also theological. He is someone who believes in and accepts the ancient dispensation according to which Mary Magdalene [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q63070] had done something which could not, in fact, be so easily forgiven. And he regards the new dispensation as an antinomian heresy which leaves him bewildered and accounts for the rather promiscuous behaviour he finds all around him in the bar. I ought to tell you also that I went on a reading tour of New England [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q18389] a few years ago, and I planned to include this, but when I got to...it has some frankly dirty language in the second stanza, and I decided that it was unbecoming at certain colleges, [audience laughter], but I was assured by a friend of mine on the faculty at Wellesley [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q49205] that the girls there were tough, and they could take it.  [Audience laughter]. He liked it, and he thought I should read it. And indeed, I did. And nobody batted an eye. So, from then on, without compunction at all, I read it everywhere else, and when I got to Mount Hollyhock, [audience laughter], there I had every intention of reading it, but they were not only taping it, as you are here this evening, but they were taping it for radio broadcast, so I felt obliged to warn the Federal Communications Commission [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q128831] [audience laughter] that this was the sort of thing that they would probably have to excise. And after the tour was over, I got a postcard from a friend of mine in that bastion of propriety, Boston [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q100], saying that he had heard the whole broadcast with nothing cut out, so I take it there's absolutely nothing wrong with it now [audience laughter]. It has, in any case, a lofty epigraph from the Book of Jonah [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q178819] [audience laughter], which says, \"Then said the Lord, 'Dost thou well, to be angry?'\u201d\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:17:57\nReads \"The Man Who Married Magdalen: Variation on a Theme by Louis Simpson\" from The Hard Hours [audience laughter throughout].\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:20:26\nA poem of a somewhat different sort, called \"Message from the City\".\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:20:37\nReads \"Message from the City\" from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:23:02\nThe poem I want to read next is also, again, on the somewhat grim side. It is, in fact, incomplete, but it stands altogether, by itself. It's going to be longer, but it is a unit, as it appears, or as I shall read it to you, and it's called, in its present state, \"The Rune\".\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:23:35\nReads \"The Rune\" from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:27:54\nI guess a really violent change of pace is required, and I can provide it. But you are not to be spared as easily as that. There's another sort of wracking one that comes up in a minute. However, I can interject something in between. There's a little sort of period piece, a Restoration comedy song, sort of, called \"The Song of the Flea\". It was written...there were a group of poems that I wrote in collaboration with an artist. We did a bestiary together, and he did a whole bunch of very handsome lithographs of animals, and I wrote a few animal poems, and this is one of them.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:28:45\nReads \"The Song of the Flea\" from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:29:40\nNow this, this next, is quite frankly a stinker, I've got to warn you. It's a very unnerving poem. It's a colloquy; there are two voices, but I'm sure you'll have no difficulty telling them apart. There is one speaker who is a kind of compulsive talker, and he has a very patient and somewhat helpless auditor. The poem is called \"Behold the Lilies of the Field\".\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:30:18\nReads \"Behold the Lilies of the Field\" from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:34:34\nThe next is a blessed relief. It's called \"Jason\", which is the name of my older son, and it's a poem written to celebrate his birth. He was born at the time I was teaching at Smith, and he was born on a Sunday, which has some bearing on the poem, but it conveniently avoided my, disrupting my academic obligations. And it has an epigraph from Doctor Faustus [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q50919], which goes, \"And from America, the Golden Fleece\".\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:35:16\nReads \"Jason\" from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:37:12\nThe next one is also, this is also rather cheery too--well, not really. I told you that I had gone on this New England tour a few years ago, and I began it in Maine [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q724]. Well, I may have been misled [distortion], but I was told at the two or three colleges and universities where I read that Maine was a dry state, and I had so arranged my poems, completely unconsciously, that I had a whole bunch of them that all took place in bars, in bars altogether [audience laughter]. So I had the feeling as I was reading--I couldn't stop, you see, there I was-- after the third poem, I felt that I appeared to be an obsessive alcoholic. [Audience laughter]. This also takes place in a bar. I was born and brought up in New York City, and remember it from the time when Third Avenue had an elevator train that ran down its length. Now, that has all been torn down. But in the old days, not only did it have the elevator train, but it was lined on both sides all the way up and down with bars. The bars are still there. But the advantage of the El was that it cast a nice, gloomy shadow over the whole avenue even on the brightest days, so that you weren't obliged to face utter reality as soon as you stepped outside [audience laughter]. There was a sort of modulating gloom that you got out into. Now that's been torn down, and it's tougher than it was. The poem is called \"Third Avenue in Sunlight\".\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:38:45\nReads \"Third Avenue in Sunlight\" from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:40:31\nThere are two more poems I should like to read. The first of these is called \"Birdwatchers of America\". It has an epigraph from the journals of Baudelaire [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q501], very near the end of his life. Baudelaire wrote as follows: \"I suffer now continually from vertigo, and today, the 23rd of January, 1862, I received a singular warning. I felt the wind of the wing of madness pass over me\".\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:41:14\nReads \"Birdwatchers of America\" from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:42:50\nThis is called \"The End of the Weekend\".\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:42:56\nReads \"The End of the Weekend\" from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:44:38\nFinally, there is a poem that I must remind you of which I enormously admire, by Matthew Arnold [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q271032]. \"Dover Beach\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5302469]. I have, in spite of my admiration for it, ventured to write a somewhat impertinent commentary upon it, which is called \"The Dover Bitch\" and subtitled [audience laughter], \"A Criticism of Life\", which is what Arnold said poetry ought to be. \n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:45:13\nReads \"The Dover Bitch: A Criticism of Life\" from The Hard Hours [audience laughter throughout].\n \nEND\n00:46:55\n[Cut off abruptly].",

These are poems that I offered in the book, very humbly, as poems that I think needed the instrumentation of the human voice, my voice, someone's voice to present them. I don't think they hold on paper. To some extent all of the poems that I've written, all of the poems anyone writes are scores for an eventual ideal performance in someone's mind's ear. More particularly in my poetry any kind of deviation from the margin represents a pitch variation, space left out indicates silence, in an obvious way, I don't know how better to do it, you know Yeats [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q40213] played around with the notion of notation for songs, then he realized the words have to do with, I understand, two of the words must do it, but there are ways of setting them down. This is a poem called \"Dates of the Calendar\".\n \nRobert Kelly\n00:01:11\nReads \"Dates of the Calendar\" [from Lectiones].\n \nRobert Kelly\n00:03:03\nI'd like really, since I've read now tiny fragments, scatter of history, I'd like now for my good to read poems that are very recent, so everything that I read from here on after will be from the summer or after, this past summer. i.e. things that are still urgent with me that I have to deal with, as to say them or give. \u201cKing of Death\u201d.\n \nRobert Kelly\n00:03:49\nReads \"King of Death\".\n \nRobert Kelly\n00:04:38\nReads unnamed poem. \n \nRobert Kelly\n00:05:47\nThat's a very difficult poem for me. It's meant to sound difficult. I mean it's not meant to flow and it's filled with rhyme and I think rhyme is the torment. The real reason that rhyme was invented must have been pain, the pain of psychosis, the pain of madness, of hoping by that fictive and easy device to cling to a measure of order, because you can get cling, cling, ring, ring, ring the way the tantric hindus make their gestures of introjection, intro- substance via mantrum, rhyme noises, [unintelligible], they say. Fellini [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7371] makes fun of it in that 8 \u00bd [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q12018], the girl in the old Hindu...But I think rhyme is madness and rhyme is pain, and maybe poets will no longer have to be madmen now that we have come to abandon rhyme. Don't you think that free-verse poets are less mad then rhyming poets? [Audience laughter]. They need order somewhere else, they can't keep it there. Alright. I mean A.A.

                "notes": "Prolific American poet, Robert Kelly, was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1935. He attended both Columbia University and the City College of New York. He took positions as a translator, later becoming a lecturer and writer-in-residence at several universities, including the California Institute of Technology, Bard College and Tufts University. In 1957, he co-founded and edited the Chelsea Review (now Chelsea) until 1960, after which he co-edited Trobar magazine until 1965. Kelly was involved in the creation of The Blue Yak poetry co-operative in New York City. His first published collection of poems was Armed Descent in 1961 (Hawk\u2019s Well Press), followed by seven other collections including Lunes\/Sightings with Jerome Rothenberg in 1964 (Hawk\u2019s Well Press), and Weeks in 1966 (El Corno Emplumado). He began editing Matter magazine in 1963, and has had affiliations with several other magazines like Caterpilar, Los, Alcheringa: Ethnopoetics and Fulcrum. Publishing over forty books of poetry, prose, essays and plays, Kelly\u2019s most notable books include The Scorpions (Doubleday, 1967), Finding the Measure (Black Sparrow Press, 1968), California Journal (Big Venus\/Asphodel, 1969), Mill of Particulars (1973), The Loom (1975), The Convections (1978), Kill the Messenger (1979), Spiritual Exercises (1981) and Not This Island Music (1987) all published by Black Sparrow Press. Robert Kelly has been the Asher B. Edelman Professor of Literature at Bard College from 1986 onwards; he was the co-director of The Writing Program and the founding member of the Milton Avery Graduate School of the Arts at Bard College. He has won many awards and honors, including a Doctor of Letters from State University of New York in 1994, the Award for Distinction from the National Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in 1986 and a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship in 1976."

                "contents": "Robert Kelly\n00:00:00\n...Read a couple of poems from a book that came out last year that's very hard to find, it's called Lectiones. These are poems that I offered in the book, very humbly, as poems that I think needed the instrumentation of the human voice, my voice, someone's voice to present them. I don't think they hold on paper. To some extent all of the poems that I've written, all of the poems anyone writes are scores for an eventual ideal performance in someone's mind's ear. More particularly in my poetry any kind of deviation from the margin represents a pitch variation, space left out indicates silence, in an obvious way, I don't know how better to do it, you know Yeats [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q40213] played around with the notion of notation for songs, then he realized the words have to do with, I understand, two of the words must do it, but there are ways of setting them down. This is a poem called \"Dates of the Calendar\".\n \nRobert Kelly\n00:01:11\nReads \"Dates of the Calendar\" [from Lectiones].\n \nRobert Kelly\n00:03:03\nI'd like really, since I've read now tiny fragments, scatter of history, I'd like now for my good to read poems that are very recent, so everything that I read from here on after will be from the summer or after, this past summer. i.e. things that are still urgent with me that I have to deal with, as to say them or give. \u201cKing of Death\u201d.\n \nRobert Kelly\n00:03:49\nReads \"King of Death\".\n \nRobert Kelly\n00:04:38\nReads unnamed poem. \n \nRobert Kelly\n00:05:47\nThat's a very difficult poem for me. It's meant to sound difficult. I mean it's not meant to flow and it's filled with rhyme and I think rhyme is the torment. The real reason that rhyme was invented must have been pain, the pain of psychosis, the pain of madness, of hoping by that fictive and easy device to cling to a measure of order, because you can get cling, cling, ring, ring, ring the way the tantric hindus make their gestures of introjection, intro- substance via mantrum, rhyme noises, [unintelligible], they say. Fellini [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7371] makes fun of it in that 8 \u00bd [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q12018], the girl in the old Hindu...But I think rhyme is madness and rhyme is pain, and maybe poets will no longer have to be madmen now that we have come to abandon rhyme. Don't you think that free-verse poets are less mad then rhyming poets? [Audience laughter]. They need order somewhere else, they can't keep it there. Alright. I mean A.A. Milne [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q207036] was probably the craziest man in the world. [Audience laughter]. This is a hard poem in a number of ways, the music of it interests me very much, it's a variety, it all fits on one page somehow but it's a long poem.

Our answer to this is that we have not attempted to make the series an exhaustive coverage of any particular school or faction of poetry. Nor has our concern been an attempt to seek out the so-called \"great poets\". Our choices have been made with the desire to present to you, hopefully, the possibilities of utterance that is more than parochial. In short, this is our attempt to sound just that diversity that so much characterizes the North American Poetry scene. Now tonight it is my very great pleasure to introduce to you two poets whose distinctiveness is more than the fact of their sex. I want to introduce each poet in turn, Phyllis Webb [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7188637] will begin the readings and after the intermission, I shall introduce to you Gwendolyn MacEwen [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4276487]. Now Phyllis Webb has published three books of poems, they are Even Your Right Eye in 1956, The Sea is Also a Garden in \u201862 and Naked Poems in \u201865. Her earlier work appeared in Trio along with Eli Mandel [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3050883] and Gael Turnbull [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5516589]. She is currently a program organizer for CBC's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q461761] Ideas Series [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5988057]. Ladies and Gentleman, Ms. Phyllis Webb.\n \nUnknown\n00:02:20\n[Cut or edit in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:02:21\nI'd like to begin with a found poem, in that it was simply given to me by a child behaving in my presence. It's called \"Alec\".\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:02:35\nReads \"Alec\".\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:04:07\nReads \"Rilke\".\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:05:58\nThis next poem is called \"Continuum\" and it's not a very extraordinary or terribly good poem even, I don't think, but it came out of a rather extraordinary experience, which was television. And it was simply a news clip from Vietnam [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q881], but this one had soundtrack on it, which made it rather more touching and inspired me to wire the Prime Minister. And shortly after that and I didn't know I was getting to the wire in the middle of it until I got there and it has to do with the almost totally impossibility of separating out objective events  that happen out there in history and in time and one's own private history. \"Continuum\".\n\nPhyllis Webb\n00:07:04\nReads \"Continuum\".\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:08:34\nI'm afraid I am suffering from the Toronto [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q172] plague which may be rampant here too. The next poem has a title longer than the poem. The title is \"A Loaf of Sliced Bread Wrapped in Cellophane and Bought at the Supermarket Where the Doors Open Without Pushing\".\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:09:04\nReads \"A Loaf of Sliced Bread Wrapped in Cellophane and Bought at the Supermarket Where the Doors Open Without Pushing\".\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:09:13\nAnd the next poem is dedicated to Paul Goodman [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q943567], and there is a quotation embedded in the poem which you will probably catch when I come to it. It's a short poem.\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:09:32\nReads unnamed poem.\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:10:06\nReads \"Poetry\".\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:11:54\nI will read now from my volume The Sea is Also a Garden. \"Propositions\".\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:12:16\nReads \"Propositions\" from The Sea is Also a Garden.\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:13:28\nThe next poem is one that seems to elicit negative vibrations from an audience in the first three quarters, so go ahead and zoom them at me.\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:13:43\nReads unnamed poem.\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:16:02\nI don't think I have the voice to read both sides of this poems tonight, there are two poems, one called \"Breaking\" and one called \"Making\". They're about the creative process that involves both those things, but \"Making\" is rather long and a little hard to read, so I'll read \"Breaking\" which is better probably as a poem.\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:16:47\nReads \"Breaking\".\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:19:04\nThe next poem is called \"The Time of Man\" and had a rather interesting genesis. I was reading an article in Horizon [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3786777] by Dr. Loren Eiseley [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2634723], which he was putting forward some ideas on evolution and it was very beautifully written this Dr. Eiseley's an excellent stylist as well as a good scientist and I discovered that as I was going through I was marking the sentences and a few days later I began writing a poem and picked up the book and listed the sentences, so this poem takes off from the Eiseley article which is called \"The Time of Man\" in which Eiseley says we must live evolution forward amongst many other interesting things and it is started with quotations, which you will get some of the time and some of the time you won't. I sent it to him for confirmation about the scientific aspects of it, he said okay, I used to write poetry too. \"The Time of Man\".\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:20:24\nReads \"The Time of Man\".\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:21:38\nReads \"Sitting\".\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:22:08\nI want to read an old poem now, which I wrote in Dublin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1761], long years ago, if I can find it. It's called \"Poems of Dublin\", where I'd gone on a sort of literary pilgrimage in search of the spirit of Yeats [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q40213] and Joyce [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6882] among others, it's a very down to earth sort of poem, in four parts.\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:22:45\nReads \"Poems of Dublin\".\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:25:33\nI want to move on now to my latest book called Naked Poems and which one of your local critics, or at least he wrote for the Montreal Star [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3521910] at this particular point, exclaimed of the price because there are so few words in the book. It's 2.25$. These poems are very small, and therefore very expensive and came at a bitter price, I may say, to me. They came quite as a surprise, I didn't know what I was doing when I wrote them, the first fourteen or so I thought, my goodness, what are these little things doing here, and I couldn't quite take them seriously and then I began to see the order that really was intrinsic in them, and realized that here was something, almost a new form for me to work on, and it's very bare, naked, undecorated and I wanted to get rid of all my affectations. And so I decided to write a couple hundred of them, and I wrote about a hundred and then got hung up on a technical problem, and finally reduced them to, I don't know, forty or so that are in this book. So this is a distillation, let's say. I'm going to read the first fourteen which comprise a total poem, in a sense the whole book is a poem. And then I'll read a few more as long as my voice and your patience will hold out. \"Suite I\".\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:27:56\nReads \"Suite I\" from Naked Poems.\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:28:53\nReads \"Flies\" from Naked Poems.\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:29:10\nReads \"Your Blouse\" from Naked Poems.\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:29:41\nReads \"Suite II\" from Naked Poems.\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:31:27\nOne of the things I was interested in doing in these poems is again this subjective and the objective, here the subject and the object relationship, so that I use objects just to speak for themselves, in a sense, and yet they are all prismed in the way I see them. And again this impossibility of the dichotomy of subjective-objective.\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:32:09\nReads unnamed poem from Naked Poems.\n \nEND\n00:32:43\n\n\ngwendolyn_macewan_i006-11-161.mp3 [File 2 of 2]\n\nRoy Kiyooka\n00:00:00\nSecond half of our program...on the second half of our program we will have Gwendolyn MacEwen reading for us. I have notes in my hand concerning her, but on the back of this album, here, a CBC [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q461761] publications release of...is it eight Canadian poets? One, two, three, four\u2026 [Audience laughter]. Yes, eight Canadian poets, this album is about to be released very shortly. There's a much more comprehensive biography of her, so I shall read this as an introduction to her. Born in Toronto [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q172] in 1941, began publishing poetry in the Canadian Forum [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5030045] at age fifteen. She left school at eighteen, a high school dropout, as the sociologists would say [audience applause and laughter] to devote herself to writing. She has published three books of poetry, The Drunken Clock, The Rising Fire, and most recently, A Breakfast for Barbarians. She has also published a novel called Julian the Magician. In 1965, she was awarded the prize for poetry in the CBC's new writing contest. With the aid of a Canada Council [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2993809] grant, she is currently at work on a novel on the, how do you pronounce the guy's name? [whispers off-mic to MacEwen]...Pharaoh Akhenaten [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q81794] [laughter] of the eighteenth dynasty in Egypt [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q79]. Ladies and gentlemen, Gwendolyn MacEwen.\n \nUnknown\n00:01:47\n[Cut or edit in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:01:47\nSo listen, I had a great idea that if our voices gave out we were just going to open up the record and bring a recorder up on a stage and place the needle in the proper groove, and then just let the record speak for itself. However, I guess the voice is intact. I'm reading first from my latest work, poems from the last year. The first is called \"The Zoo\".\n  \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:02:22\nReads \"The Zoo\".\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:03:38\nNot feeling that I'd sufficiently exploited beasts and things, I wrote another called \"The Taming of the Dragon\".\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:03:49\nReads \"The Taming of the Dragon\".\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:04:57\nStill not having exploited the animal kingdom, I wrote a poem which, well, is not connected with the animal kingdom at all, really. It's called \"The Horse-head Nebula\".\n  \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:05:12\nReads \"The Horse-head Nebula\".\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:06:19.86\nReads \"Wheels\".\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:07:18\nThis is a poem which, oddly enough, came out in a Mexican magazine in Spanish not too long ago, looking completely unrecognizable to me. It's called \"I Should Have Predicted\".\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:07:38\nReads \"I Should Have Predicted\" [published later in The Shadow-Maker].\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:08:47\nSome people have asked me if that poem was about Toronto, and I'm at a loss to answer, not having seen horses, riders, chariots, or anything remotely similar in Toronto. Plus the fact, I'm sure many people have predicted the death of Toronto, as far as that goes. I recall Phyllis reading a poem on perhaps an evolutionary theme, and I have one here called \"The Heel\".\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:09:32\nReads \"The Heel\" [published later in The Shadow-Maker].\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:11:16\nNow, I think I can safely move into Breakfast for Barbarians. It needs a little preparation, a little cushioning, perhaps. This is a poem called \"The Garden of Square Roots: An Autobiography\".\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:12:01\nReads \"The Garden of Square Roots: An Autobiography\" from A Breakfast for Barbarians.\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:13:33\nI think all poets should have some suffering poems, poems of great anguish. So feeling I was somewhat deficient in this area [audience laughter], I made use of a very opportune situation, recovering from an appendectomy in hospital. [Audience laughter]. Deciding that surely this was my moment, if I was ever going to write a painful poem it must be now. [Audience laughter]. So this is \"Appendectomy\".\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:14:20\nReads \"Appendectomy\".\n \nUnknown\n00:14:22\n[High-pitched sound. Possible damage to recording].\n \nUnknown\n00:14:57\n[High-pitched sound. Possible damage to recording].\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:15:20\nAlthough I can't say that I'm convinced that that suffering was valid, either. But. The next poem is called \"The Self Assumes\", and I rarely talk about how a poem gets written because it seems mostly irrelevant, but I would remark that the last line of this poem was one of those very strange, surprising things that comes to one almost instantaneously, and one plucks it out of the air. I was very delighted with it. \"The Self Assumes\".\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:16:08\nReads \"The Self Assumes\".\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:18:01\nThe next poem is one of a group of poems toward the end of this book where the, I think the tone or the voice takes a somewhat radical departure from the poems in the rest of the book. It's called \"The Caravan\".\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:18:23\nReads \"The Caravan\" from A Breakfast for Barbarians. \n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:20:29\nI'm trying to locate a poem in this book which I realized doesn't exist. It's somewhere else altogether. I'd like to end this reading with a trilogy of poems. Which are also toward the end of Breakfast for Barbarians. Poems which, for me, represent a stage in my own growth as a poet. They are called the Arcanum poems, I believe they're on the record which Roy Kiyooka [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3445789] was showing you. \n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:21:15\nReads \"Arcanum One\" from A Breakfast for Barbarians.\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:22:35\nBefore I go into \"Arcanum Two\", in case anyone is mystified with beetles and suns and various creatures like that, let me say that the book is, the poem, rather, is of an Egyptian theme. A royal house. And the events taking place within it. So we move on: \"Arcanum Two\".\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:23:05\nReads \"Arcanum Two\" from A Breakfast for Barbarians.\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:24:33\nAnd finally, \"Arcanum Three\".\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:24:39\nReads \"Arcanum Three\" from A Breakfast for Barbarians.\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:25:31\nThank you very much. \n \nUnknown\n00:25:34\n[Cut or edit in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed]. \n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:25:34\n...everybody here, I want to thank Gwendolyn MacEwen. Our night three is on December the second.

She completed a B.A. in Philosophy and English at University of British Columbia and at the young age of twenty-two, she ran as a CCF candidate for the B.C. legislature. She finished one year of graduate studies at McGill University in 1950 in Montreal. She traveled and lived in San Francisco, Paris and England before settling back in B.C. where she taught at UBC for four years. Her first poems were published in Trio (Contact Press) in 1954 with Eli Mandel and Gael Turnbull, and in Even your right eye in 1956 (McClelland and Stewart).

                "notes": "Poet, novelist and short story writer Gwendolyn MacEwen was born in Toronto in 1941, and spent her childhood there and in Winnipeg. Her first poem was published in The Canadian Forum, and a year later, when she was eighteen, she left school to pursue a career in writing. She self-published her first two collections of poetry, Selah and The drunken clock in 1961 (Aleph Press). In 1962, she briefly married fellow poet Milton Acorn, published her first novel, Julian the magician (Macmillan, 1963), and a collection of poetry, The rising fire (Contact Press, 1963), which established her reputation on the Canadian scene at the age of twenty-two. That same year, her work was published in Jacques Godbout and John Robert Colombo\u2019s anthology Poetry 64\/Poesie 64 (Ryerson Press\/ Editions du jour, 1963). MacEwen followed this success with poetry collections A Breakfast for Barbarians (Ryerson Press, 1966), The Shadow-Maker (Macmillan, 1969) which won a Governor General\u2019s Award for poetry, The Armies of the Moon (Macmillan, 1972), which won the A.J.M. Smith Poetry Award, Magic Animals: Selected Poems (Macmillan, 1975), The Fire-Eaters (Oberon Press, 1976), The T.E. Lawrence Poems (Mosaic Press\/Valley Editions, 1982) and Earthlight: Selected Poems (General Publisher, 1982). She was re-married to Greek singer Nikos Tsingos, who introduced her to worlds Mediterranean. MacEwen published in other genres, including a CBC verse play Terror and Erebus (reprinted as Afterworlds in 1987), novel King of Egypt, King of Dreams (Macmillan, 1971), collections of short stories Norman (Oberon Press, 1972) and Norman\u2019s Land (1985), travel book Mermaids and Ikons: A Greek Summer (Anansi, 1978), a translation of Euripides\u2019 The Trojan Women: A Play (Playwright\u2019s Co-op, 1979), and two children\u2019s books, The chocolate moose (New Canada Publications, 1981) and The honey drum (Mosaic Press, Flatiron Books, 1983).  Her last publication, Afterworlds (McClelland and Stewart, 1987) won a Governor General\u2019s Award, and was published shortly before her death in 1987. Two volumes of selected work appeared posthumously, The poetry of Gwendolyn MacEwen: the early years (Exile Editions, 1993) and The poetry of Gwendolyn MacEwen: the later years (Exile Editions, 1994) edited by Margaret Atwood and Barry Callaghan."

Our answer to this is that we have not attempted to make the series an exhaustive coverage of any particular school or faction of poetry. Nor has our concern been an attempt to seek out the so-called \"great poets\". Our choices have been made with the desire to present to you, hopefully, the possibilities of utterance that is more than parochial. In short, this is our attempt to sound just that diversity that so much characterizes the North American Poetry scene. Now tonight it is my very great pleasure to introduce to you two poets whose distinctiveness is more than the fact of their sex. I want to introduce each poet in turn, Phyllis Webb [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7188637] will begin the readings and after the intermission, I shall introduce to you Gwendolyn MacEwen [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4276487]. Now Phyllis Webb has published three books of poems, they are Even Your Right Eye in 1956, The Sea is Also a Garden in \u201862 and Naked Poems in \u201865. Her earlier work appeared in Trio along with Eli Mandel [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3050883] and Gael Turnbull [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5516589]. She is currently a program organizer for CBC's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q461761] Ideas Series [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5988057]. Ladies and Gentleman, Ms. Phyllis Webb.\n \nUnknown\n00:02:20\n[Cut or edit in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:02:21\nI'd like to begin with a found poem, in that it was simply given to me by a child behaving in my presence. It's called \"Alec\".\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:02:35\nReads \"Alec\".\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:04:07\nReads \"Rilke\".\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:05:58\nThis next poem is called \"Continuum\" and it's not a very extraordinary or terribly good poem even, I don't think, but it came out of a rather extraordinary experience, which was television. And it was simply a news clip from Vietnam [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q881], but this one had soundtrack on it, which made it rather more touching and inspired me to wire the Prime Minister. And shortly after that and I didn't know I was getting to the wire in the middle of it until I got there and it has to do with the almost totally impossibility of separating out objective events  that happen out there in history and in time and one's own private history. \"Continuum\".\n\nPhyllis Webb\n00:07:04\nReads \"Continuum\".\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:08:34\nI'm afraid I am suffering from the Toronto [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q172] plague which may be rampant here too. The next poem has a title longer than the poem. The title is \"A Loaf of Sliced Bread Wrapped in Cellophane and Bought at the Supermarket Where the Doors Open Without Pushing\".\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:09:04\nReads \"A Loaf of Sliced Bread Wrapped in Cellophane and Bought at the Supermarket Where the Doors Open Without Pushing\".\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:09:13\nAnd the next poem is dedicated to Paul Goodman [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q943567], and there is a quotation embedded in the poem which you will probably catch when I come to it. It's a short poem.\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:09:32\nReads unnamed poem.\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:10:06\nReads \"Poetry\".\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:11:54\nI will read now from my volume The Sea is Also a Garden. \"Propositions\".\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:12:16\nReads \"Propositions\" from The Sea is Also a Garden.\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:13:28\nThe next poem is one that seems to elicit negative vibrations from an audience in the first three quarters, so go ahead and zoom them at me.\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:13:43\nReads unnamed poem.\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:16:02\nI don't think I have the voice to read both sides of this poems tonight, there are two poems, one called \"Breaking\" and one called \"Making\". They're about the creative process that involves both those things, but \"Making\" is rather long and a little hard to read, so I'll read \"Breaking\" which is better probably as a poem.\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:16:47\nReads \"Breaking\".\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:19:04\nThe next poem is called \"The Time of Man\" and had a rather interesting genesis. I was reading an article in Horizon [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3786777] by Dr. Loren Eiseley [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2634723], which he was putting forward some ideas on evolution and it was very beautifully written this Dr. Eiseley's an excellent stylist as well as a good scientist and I discovered that as I was going through I was marking the sentences and a few days later I began writing a poem and picked up the book and listed the sentences, so this poem takes off from the Eiseley article which is called \"The Time of Man\" in which Eiseley says we must live evolution forward amongst many other interesting things and it is started with quotations, which you will get some of the time and some of the time you won't. I sent it to him for confirmation about the scientific aspects of it, he said okay, I used to write poetry too. \"The Time of Man\".\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:20:24\nReads \"The Time of Man\".\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:21:38\nReads \"Sitting\".\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:22:08\nI want to read an old poem now, which I wrote in Dublin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1761], long years ago, if I can find it. It's called \"Poems of Dublin\", where I'd gone on a sort of literary pilgrimage in search of the spirit of Yeats [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q40213] and Joyce [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6882] among others, it's a very down to earth sort of poem, in four parts.\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:22:45\nReads \"Poems of Dublin\".\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:25:33\nI want to move on now to my latest book called Naked Poems and which one of your local critics, or at least he wrote for the Montreal Star [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3521910] at this particular point, exclaimed of the price because there are so few words in the book. It's 2.25$. These poems are very small, and therefore very expensive and came at a bitter price, I may say, to me. They came quite as a surprise, I didn't know what I was doing when I wrote them, the first fourteen or so I thought, my goodness, what are these little things doing here, and I couldn't quite take them seriously and then I began to see the order that really was intrinsic in them, and realized that here was something, almost a new form for me to work on, and it's very bare, naked, undecorated and I wanted to get rid of all my affectations. And so I decided to write a couple hundred of them, and I wrote about a hundred and then got hung up on a technical problem, and finally reduced them to, I don't know, forty or so that are in this book. So this is a distillation, let's say. I'm going to read the first fourteen which comprise a total poem, in a sense the whole book is a poem. And then I'll read a few more as long as my voice and your patience will hold out. \"Suite I\".\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:27:56\nReads \"Suite I\" from Naked Poems.\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:28:53\nReads \"Flies\" from Naked Poems.\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:29:10\nReads \"Your Blouse\" from Naked Poems.\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:29:41\nReads \"Suite II\" from Naked Poems.\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:31:27\nOne of the things I was interested in doing in these poems is again this subjective and the objective, here the subject and the object relationship, so that I use objects just to speak for themselves, in a sense, and yet they are all prismed in the way I see them. And again this impossibility of the dichotomy of subjective-objective.\n \nPhyllis Webb\n00:32:09\nReads unnamed poem from Naked Poems.\n \nEND\n00:32:43\n",

One, two, three, four\u2026 [Audience laughter]. Yes, eight Canadian poets, this album is about to be released very shortly. There's a much more comprehensive biography of her, so I shall read this as an introduction to her. Born in Toronto [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q172] in 1941, began publishing poetry in the Canadian Forum [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5030045] at age fifteen. She left school at eighteen, a high school dropout, as the sociologists would say [audience applause and laughter] to devote herself to writing. She has published three books of poetry, The Drunken Clock, The Rising Fire, and most recently, A Breakfast for Barbarians. She has also published a novel called Julian the Magician. In 1965, she was awarded the prize for poetry in the CBC's new writing contest. With the aid of a Canada Council [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2993809] grant, she is currently at work on a novel on the, how do you pronounce the guy's name? [whispers off-mic to MacEwen]...Pharaoh Akhenaten [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q81794] [laughter] of the eighteenth dynasty in Egypt [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q79]. Ladies and gentlemen, Gwendolyn MacEwen.\n \nUnknown\n00:01:47\n[Cut or edit in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:01:47\nSo listen, I had a great idea that if our voices gave out we were just going to open up the record and bring a recorder up on a stage and place the needle in the proper groove, and then just let the record speak for itself. However, I guess the voice is intact. I'm reading first from my latest work, poems from the last year. The first is called \"The Zoo\".\n  \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:02:22\nReads \"The Zoo\".\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:03:38\nNot feeling that I'd sufficiently exploited beasts and things, I wrote another called \"The Taming of the Dragon\".\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:03:49\nReads \"The Taming of the Dragon\".\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:04:57\nStill not having exploited the animal kingdom, I wrote a poem which, well, is not connected with the animal kingdom at all, really. It's called \"The Horse-head Nebula\".\n  \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:05:12\nReads \"The Horse-head Nebula\".\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:06:19.86\nReads \"Wheels\".\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:07:18\nThis is a poem which, oddly enough, came out in a Mexican magazine in Spanish not too long ago, looking completely unrecognizable to me. It's called \"I Should Have Predicted\".\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:07:38\nReads \"I Should Have Predicted\" [published later in The Shadow-Maker].\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:08:47\nSome people have asked me if that poem was about Toronto, and I'm at a loss to answer, not having seen horses, riders, chariots, or anything remotely similar in Toronto. Plus the fact, I'm sure many people have predicted the death of Toronto, as far as that goes. I recall Phyllis reading a poem on perhaps an evolutionary theme, and I have one here called \"The Heel\".\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:09:32\nReads \"The Heel\" [published later in The Shadow-Maker].\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:11:16\nNow, I think I can safely move into Breakfast for Barbarians. It needs a little preparation, a little cushioning, perhaps. This is a poem called \"The Garden of Square Roots: An Autobiography\".\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:12:01\nReads \"The Garden of Square Roots: An Autobiography\" from A Breakfast for Barbarians.\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:13:33\nI think all poets should have some suffering poems, poems of great anguish. So feeling I was somewhat deficient in this area [audience laughter], I made use of a very opportune situation, recovering from an appendectomy in hospital. [Audience laughter]. Deciding that surely this was my moment, if I was ever going to write a painful poem it must be now. [Audience laughter]. So this is \"Appendectomy\".\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:14:20\nReads \"Appendectomy\".\n \nUnknown\n00:14:22\n[High-pitched sound. Possible damage to recording].\n \nUnknown\n00:14:57\n[High-pitched sound. Possible damage to recording].\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:15:20\nAlthough I can't say that I'm convinced that that suffering was valid, either. But. The next poem is called \"The Self Assumes\", and I rarely talk about how a poem gets written because it seems mostly irrelevant, but I would remark that the last line of this poem was one of those very strange, surprising things that comes to one almost instantaneously, and one plucks it out of the air. I was very delighted with it. \"The Self Assumes\".\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:16:08\nReads \"The Self Assumes\".\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:18:01\nThe next poem is one of a group of poems toward the end of this book where the, I think the tone or the voice takes a somewhat radical departure from the poems in the rest of the book. It's called \"The Caravan\".\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:18:23\nReads \"The Caravan\" from A Breakfast for Barbarians. \n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:20:29\nI'm trying to locate a poem in this book which I realized doesn't exist. It's somewhere else altogether. I'd like to end this reading with a trilogy of poems. Which are also toward the end of Breakfast for Barbarians. Poems which, for me, represent a stage in my own growth as a poet. They are called the Arcanum poems, I believe they're on the record which Roy Kiyooka [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3445789] was showing you. \n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:21:15\nReads \"Arcanum One\" from A Breakfast for Barbarians.\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:22:35\nBefore I go into \"Arcanum Two\", in case anyone is mystified with beetles and suns and various creatures like that, let me say that the book is, the poem, rather, is of an Egyptian theme. A royal house. And the events taking place within it. So we move on: \"Arcanum Two\".\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:23:05\nReads \"Arcanum Two\" from A Breakfast for Barbarians.\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:24:33\nAnd finally, \"Arcanum Three\".\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:24:39\nReads \"Arcanum Three\" from A Breakfast for Barbarians.\n \nGwendolyn MacEwen\n00:25:31\nThank you very much. \n \nUnknown\n00:25:34\n[Cut or edit in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed]. \n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:25:34\n...everybody here, I want to thank Gwendolyn MacEwen. Our night three is on December the second.

Tonight there will be readings by two poets living in Montreal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q340], and members of the faculty of this university. There will be a fifteen minute intermission in between each reading. Roy Kiyooka [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3445789] was born in Moose Jaw [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1019496], Saskatchewan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1989], he studied at the Provincial Institute of Technology and Art, the Instituto Allende [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q17989128] in Mexico [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q96], and the University of Saskatchewan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1514848] Emma Lake Workshops.

He exhibited at the Sao Paulo Biennial [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q653360], where he was one of four painters representing Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16], and where he received honourable mention and a Silver Medal. His most recent show was held last month at the Laing Galleries [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q28846441] in Toronto. In 1964, his first volume of poems, Kyoto Airs, was published by the Periwinkle Press in Vancouver. His second volume, Nevertheless These Eyes is being published this month, in Montreal by Bev Leech. Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. Roy Kiyooka.\n \nUnknown\n00:01:24\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n\nRoy Kiyooka\n00:01:25\n--want to start off this evening by reading a few poems from my earlier book, the one that Stan mentioned. These poems were written as a result of a summer in Japan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q17], and they are very much occasional poems, they address themselves to the particular occasion of having been there, and they were meant in part to account for that experience of having been there, to my numerable friends in Vancouver. I'll begin by reading three very short little poems, they all relate to, what should we call it, the various contexts in which I saw the sculptured image of the Buddha. The first one is called \"Waiting Out the Rain\".\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:02:51\nReads \"Waiting Out the Rain\" [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:03:13\nThis is \"Buddha in the Garden\". Again, very brief.\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:03:23\nReads \"Buddha in the Garden\" [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:03:47\nThis is \"Sunday at the Temple\".\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:03:53\nReads \"Sunday at the Temple\" [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:04:20\nAnd this is the image of a Buddha seen in the Kyoto Museum, a reclining figure.\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:04:30\nReads unnamed poem [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:05:01\nNow the next is a sequence of four little poems, very much like the traditional Japanese poems called the Haiku. This is a sequence, the title of which is \"The Stone Garden of Ryoanji\". The first one goes like this:\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:05:27\nReads \u201cThe Stone Garden of Ryoanji\", part 1 [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:05:45\nReads \u201cThe Stone Garden of Ryoanji\", part 2 [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:06:07\nReads \u201cThe Stone Garden of Ryoanji\", part 3 [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:06:24\nReads \u201cThe Stone Garden of Ryoanji\", part 4 [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:06:49\nNow this one is called \"Children's Shrine\". Throughout most of the cities and towns and villages all over Japan you'll find way-side shrines, they're frequently just built into the wall in a very narrow street and people on whatever religious occasion come to worship there. This is a shrine particularly for children. And it goes like this:\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:07:24\nReads \"Children's Shrine\" [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:08:41\nWell this is rather a long sequence, once more very short poems, there are eleven of them, and the title of the sequence is simply \"Higashiyama\", now 'higashiyama' means, in English, 'east mountain'.\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:09:22\nReads \"Higashiyama\", part 1 [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:09:39\nReads \"Higashiyama\", part 2 [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:10:04\nReads \"Higashiyama\", part 3 [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:10:20\nReads \"Higashiyama\", part 4 [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:10:38\nReads \"Higashiyama\", part 5 [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:10:54\nReads \"Higashiyama\", part 6 [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:11:13\nReads \"Higashiyama\", part 7 [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:11:38\nReads \"Higashiyama\", part 8 [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:11:55\nReads \"Higashiyama\", part 9 [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:12:17\nReads \"Higashiyama\", part 10 [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:12:43\nReads \"Higashiyama\", part 11 [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:13:01\nWell I'll go on to the last poem in the book, this is an attempt, as it were, to sum up the varied experiences that I had there. The poem is called \"Itinerary of a View\".\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:13:29\nReads \"Itinerary of a View\" [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:17:07\nI think I need to say a few words about this next group of poems, they were, they're from the book that I am having done at the moment, I started these poems in June 1965 in Montreal when I first came here. I don't know how to tell you this, except that at the time I came, I stayed with Alfred Pinsky [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q21997094], or rather I stayed at his home, at his invitation, while I was looking for a place to live. Now, this took me about two weeks, it was very hot, and in the evenings I used to go through his library and pick up things and scanned them. One evening I came across this book, which was a biography of the English painter, Stanley Spencer [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1282413]. Spencer, we could say is perhaps the co-partner in the origin and the form and the content of this book. The book is in three parts, the first part is called the mirror, \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", and it is prefaced by a quotation from Spencer, which goes like this: \"I am meeting you all the time, and sending my longing for you into chaos, into the darkness, beyond these walls\". I may add that these poems, likewise, are on the whole, very brief, though some are longer.\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:19:31\nReads \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", part 1 [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:20:34\nReads \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", part 2 [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:21:55\nReads \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", part 3 published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:22:49\nReads \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", part 4 [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:23:23\nReads \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", part 5 [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:24:18\nReads \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", part 6 [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n\nRoy Kiyooka\n00:24:46\nReads \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", part 7 [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n\nRoy Kiyooka\n00:25:24\nReads \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", part 8 [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n\nRoy Kiyooka\n00:25:51\nReads \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", part 9 [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n\nRoy Kiyooka\n00:26:27\nReads \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", part 10 [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n\nRoy Kiyooka\n00:27:02\nReads \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", part 11 [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n\nRoy Kiyooka\n00:27:26\nReads \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", part 12 [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:28:06\nReads \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", part 13 [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:28:36\nReads \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", part 14 [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:29:21\nReads \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", part 15 [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:30:05\nThe last one in this section.\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:30:11\nReads \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", part 16 [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:30:53\nThere's a terrible draft coming in from the back, I think you're right Dick, we're going to end up with arthritic ankles. Well, this is the second section, and it is called \"The Proposal\". Once more, prefaced with a remark from Stanley Spencer, a very beautiful one. They are set down, as I found them in the book, I have used them in the context of this section of the book and these four poems, taken from his writings are meant to define certain of her attributes. Now I have given a title to each one of these four poems, and I hope they will clarify the context in which they belong here. \"Portrait of the Beloved\".\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:32:06\nReads \"Portrait of the Beloved\" [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:32:56\nThis I called \"The Marriage\".\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:33:05\nReads \"The Marriage\" [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:33:37\nThis is called \"The Separation\".\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:33:45\nReads \"The Separation\" [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:34:07\nAnd this, is \"Her Apotheosis\".\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:34:17\nReads \"Her Apotheosis\" [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:35:23\nThat incidentally, is a description he wrote to a friend about a painting that he in fact had made.

In 1958 he was a recipient of the Academy of American Poets [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q282096] Prize, and over a period of several years published his poems in the Harvard Advocate. He has given readings in Cambridge [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q49111], Minneapolis [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q36091], and in Oslo [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q585]. Also, he does not want me to mention his scholarly publications: Dash, Which Are, Strangers and Pilgrims, an essay on the Metaphor of the Journey written with Georg Roppen [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q23944662] and published by the Humanities Press [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q97958829] in New York City, as well as by the Norwegian University's Press, in Norway [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q20] and A Monograph, the Odyssey and Primitive Religion, published by the University of Bergen [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q204457] in 1962. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Dick Sommer.\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:01:02\nI didn't want him to mention those. Oh I've got the deal with Roy, as well. So this is a haiku with, which you'll be glad to know also has seventeen syllables in the title. \"The Haiku to Roy Kiyooka\", in reply to his haiku to me.\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:01:31\nReads \"The Haiku to Roy Kiyooka\".\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:01:50\nAnd this is the Haiku that began the mess, this was the one that I originally threatened to read to him, and naturally will carry out my threat. Which has a slightly different title, \"Haiku at Roy Kiyooka\"\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:02:07\nReads \"Haiku at Roy Kiyooka\".\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:02:27\nAnd then there's the one that I think you have on that broadsheet, which as I looked at it, in all of its mimeographed splendor, struck me as sounding a bit, now, like the theme song of the Central Intelligence Agency [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q37230], but I'm sorry about that, I didn't mean it that way when I wrote it.\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:02:55\nReads unnamed haiku.\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:03:13\nI'm as you've heard, I'm responsible for having written some criticism, sorry about that, but I hope to make it up with the next poem, which is also on your broadsheet. Called the meaning of- \"The Meaning of Poetry\".\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:03:36\nReads \"The Meaning of Poetry\".\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:04:19\nAnd this next poem, you'll be very happy to know I have my wife's permission to read.\n\nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:04:26\nReads unnamed poem.\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:05:02\nYou're going to be out of luck if you don't play chess, for this next one. You may be out of luck if you do, but that has more to do with the poem than your ability at chess.\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:05:23\nReads unnamed poem. \n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:06:27\nRoy's given us a series of poems in praise of 'her', I don't know who 'her' is, but I have another name for her myself, she's called the Lady of Situations, and that's the title of this poem. You know, situations in the sense of she's always getting involved, or people are always getting involved. This is that Lady of Situation. And, oh yes, there's some erudition in this one too, there's a marvelous drawing taken from the tomb of Tuthmosis [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1320491], which appears in the Skera, Egyptian Painting Volume, and you might look it up because she appears there as a tree, a breasted tree, and giving suck to a Pharaoh, it's quite interesting as a painting, anyway, that's in here too.\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:07:34\nReads \"Lady of Situation\".\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:09:29\nThe, I noticed that the Brotherhood of Railroad Engineers has arranged to have separate drinking glasses, or they're trying to get themselves put into the sanitary code, I think this is Roy's. This must be mine, still water. This next one, I wrote the day following my seeing of a movie that I hope many of you are familiar with, it's the Russian version of Don Quixote [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q49612156], a lovely film, beautiful adaptation of the myth of Don Quixote, and Sancho Panza [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q630823] in the terms of the revolution to come, and I was particularly fascinated to the title that was given to Don Quixote, in this film, so I used it for the title of the poem.\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:10:54\nReads \"Don Quixote de la Manchesky\".\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:13:25\nThis next one takes its title, this is another area of that reference, takes its title from a little known and very important folk ballad, I had to put something in ethnic here, so this is it. It's, the title is \"The Other Side of the Mountain\", and it comes from that little song that begins \"The bear climbed over the mountain to see what he could see, but the other side of the mountain was all that he could see\".\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:14:05\nReads \"The Other Side of the Mountain\".\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:17:15\nIncidentally, you must not get the idea that the mountain, you know, came entirely from the, from the, from the song. It, you can find it on the Greater Barrington Quadrangle, for the appropriate section of the Massachusetts [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q771] of the US [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30] geological survey, it's right on the map. It's really there, it's got position. This poem is in four sections, there are three narrative sections and then there's a short epilogue. And it's called \"My Loveliest Enemies\". I don't think there's any point in keeping you in suspense about this, my loveliest enemies are birds. And that's the punchline, so now you know it and you can listen to the poem.\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:18:24\nReads \"My Loveliest Enemies\" [parts 1-3].\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:33:12\nAnd here's the epilogue.\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:33:19\nReads \"Epilogue\" of \"My Loveliest Enemies\".\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:35:52\nIt's a race against not time but against the creeping gelatination, I think is the word of my lower extremities, and I'm sure the creeping sleepiness that is likely to affect you. This next, excuse me, here's to you! This next poem requires an erudite explanation too and I'm sorry for that. I hope, actually, it's not necessary. Alcuin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q154332], the Charles the King, Alcuin was an 8th century scholar who was brought from his, from the York [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q42462] diocese, to the court of Charlemagne [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3044], and there became the principal architect of Charlemagne's attempt to bring Latin and Latin culture to the Francs. You might say, I suppose, that he was the first of, first great humanist, but we'll see what his Latin is worth in this poem. This is a letter, written by Alcuin, actually it was written by me, presumably written by Alcuin, to Charles the King.\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:37:33\nReads \"Letter written by Alcuin, to Charles the King\".\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:41:46\nAnd this poem is, has a title, and a subtitle. The title is \"Concentration\" the subtitle, \"Homage to Eva Jerome\".\n\nEND\n00:42:12\n[Cut off abruptly]."

His second publication, Strangers and Pilgrims: An Essay on the Metaphor of Journey, was published in 1964, written with Georg Roppen (Humanities Press). Sommer\u2019s collections of poetry that have been published by Delta Canada include Homage to Mr. MacMullin (Delta Canada, 1969), The Blue Sky Notebook (New Delta, 1972), Milarepa (New Delta, 1976), Left Hand Mind (New Delta, 1976), The Other Side of Games (New Delta, 1977), and Selected and New Poems (1983) published by Vehicule Press.

Sculptor, painter, photographer, poet, film-maker and teacher, he was influential in many important literary and artistic scenes all across Canada. Kiyooka studied fine art at the Provincial Institute of Art and Technology in Alberta, the Institute Allende in Mexico, the University of Saskatchewan, Emma Lake Workshops. He married Monica Dealtry Barker in 1955 and had three children.  He has exhibited his works in numerous cities, including Edmonton, Calgary, San Miguel D\u2019Allende, Saskatoon, Regina, Vancouver, Toronto, New York and Montreal. Kiyooka\u2019s work was shown at the National Gallery of Canada and the Museum of Modern Art in Washington, D.C. He won the silver medal representing Canada at the Sao Paulo Biennial in 1966. Kiyooka taught at various institutions, including Regina College, where he worked from 1956 to 1960, the Vancouver School of Art (Now Emily Carr Institute of Art + Design) from 1960-1965, Sir George Williams University (now Concordia University) from 1966 to 1969 and the University of British Columbia from 1972 to his retirement. During the 60\u2019s, Kiyooka played a crucial role in the artistic renaissance of Vancouver poetry and art, and served to connect the Vancouver scene with the Coach House Press group in Toronto. It was around this time that he began writing poetry, publishing Kyoto airs in 1964 (Periwinkle Press), illustrating Daphne Marlatt\u2019s The unquiet bed in 1967, Nevertheless these eyes also in 1967 (Coach House Press), Stoned gloves in 1970 (Coach House Press), Transcanada letters in 1975 (Talon Books), The Fontainebleau dream machine: 18 frames from a book in 1977 (Coach House Press), and Of seasonal pleasures and small hindrances in 1978 (B.C. Monthly). Pacific windows: collected poems of Roy Kiyooka came out in 1974 (Talon Books), and included a biography, bibliography and notes on his poetry. Pear tree poems came out almost a decade later in 1988 (Coach House Press) and was nominated for a Governor General\u2019s Award. More recently he published Mothertalk: Life Stories of Mary Kiyoshi Kiyooka in 1997(NeWest Press), edited by Daphne Marlatt. Roy Kiyooka died in 1994."

Tonight there will be readings by two poets living in Montreal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q340], and members of the faculty of this university. There will be a fifteen minute intermission in between each reading. Roy Kiyooka [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3445789] was born in Moose Jaw [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1019496], Saskatchewan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1989], he studied at the Provincial Institute of Technology and Art, the Instituto Allende [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q17989128] in Mexico [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q96], and the University of Saskatchewan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1514848] Emma Lake Workshops.

He exhibited at the Sao Paulo Biennial [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q653360], where he was one of four painters representing Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16], and where he received honourable mention and a Silver Medal. His most recent show was held last month at the Laing Galleries [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q28846441] in Toronto. In 1964, his first volume of poems, Kyoto Airs, was published by the Periwinkle Press in Vancouver. His second volume, Nevertheless These Eyes is being published this month, in Montreal by Bev Leech. Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. Roy Kiyooka.\n \nUnknown\n00:01:24\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n\nRoy Kiyooka\n00:01:25\n--want to start off this evening by reading a few poems from my earlier book, the one that Stan mentioned. These poems were written as a result of a summer in Japan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q17], and they are very much occasional poems, they address themselves to the particular occasion of having been there, and they were meant in part to account for that experience of having been there, to my numerable friends in Vancouver. I'll begin by reading three very short little poems, they all relate to, what should we call it, the various contexts in which I saw the sculptured image of the Buddha. The first one is called \"Waiting Out the Rain\".\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:02:51\nReads \"Waiting Out the Rain\" [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:03:13\nThis is \"Buddha in the Garden\". Again, very brief.\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:03:23\nReads \"Buddha in the Garden\" [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:03:47\nThis is \"Sunday at the Temple\".\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:03:53\nReads \"Sunday at the Temple\" [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:04:20\nAnd this is the image of a Buddha seen in the Kyoto Museum, a reclining figure.\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:04:30\nReads unnamed poem [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:05:01\nNow the next is a sequence of four little poems, very much like the traditional Japanese poems called the Haiku. This is a sequence, the title of which is \"The Stone Garden of Ryoanji\". The first one goes like this:\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:05:27\nReads \u201cThe Stone Garden of Ryoanji\", part 1 [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:05:45\nReads \u201cThe Stone Garden of Ryoanji\", part 2 [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:06:07\nReads \u201cThe Stone Garden of Ryoanji\", part 3 [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:06:24\nReads \u201cThe Stone Garden of Ryoanji\", part 4 [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:06:49\nNow this one is called \"Children's Shrine\". Throughout most of the cities and towns and villages all over Japan you'll find way-side shrines, they're frequently just built into the wall in a very narrow street and people on whatever religious occasion come to worship there. This is a shrine particularly for children. And it goes like this:\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:07:24\nReads \"Children's Shrine\" [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:08:41\nWell this is rather a long sequence, once more very short poems, there are eleven of them, and the title of the sequence is simply \"Higashiyama\", now 'higashiyama' means, in English, 'east mountain'.\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:09:22\nReads \"Higashiyama\", part 1 [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:09:39\nReads \"Higashiyama\", part 2 [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:10:04\nReads \"Higashiyama\", part 3 [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:10:20\nReads \"Higashiyama\", part 4 [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:10:38\nReads \"Higashiyama\", part 5 [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:10:54\nReads \"Higashiyama\", part 6 [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:11:13\nReads \"Higashiyama\", part 7 [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:11:38\nReads \"Higashiyama\", part 8 [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:11:55\nReads \"Higashiyama\", part 9 [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:12:17\nReads \"Higashiyama\", part 10 [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:12:43\nReads \"Higashiyama\", part 11 [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:13:01\nWell I'll go on to the last poem in the book, this is an attempt, as it were, to sum up the varied experiences that I had there. The poem is called \"Itinerary of a View\".\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:13:29\nReads \"Itinerary of a View\" [from Kyoto Airs].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:17:07\nI think I need to say a few words about this next group of poems, they were, they're from the book that I am having done at the moment, I started these poems in June 1965 in Montreal when I first came here. I don't know how to tell you this, except that at the time I came, I stayed with Alfred Pinsky [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q21997094], or rather I stayed at his home, at his invitation, while I was looking for a place to live. Now, this took me about two weeks, it was very hot, and in the evenings I used to go through his library and pick up things and scanned them. One evening I came across this book, which was a biography of the English painter, Stanley Spencer [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1282413]. Spencer, we could say is perhaps the co-partner in the origin and the form and the content of this book. The book is in three parts, the first part is called the mirror, \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", and it is prefaced by a quotation from Spencer, which goes like this: \"I am meeting you all the time, and sending my longing for you into chaos, into the darkness, beyond these walls\". I may add that these poems, likewise, are on the whole, very brief, though some are longer.\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:19:31\nReads \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", part 1 [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:20:34\nReads \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", part 2 [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:21:55\nReads \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", part 3 published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:22:49\nReads \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", part 4 [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:23:23\nReads \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", part 5 [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:24:18\nReads \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", part 6 [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n\nRoy Kiyooka\n00:24:46\nReads \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", part 7 [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n\nRoy Kiyooka\n00:25:24\nReads \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", part 8 [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n\nRoy Kiyooka\n00:25:51\nReads \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", part 9 [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n\nRoy Kiyooka\n00:26:27\nReads \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", part 10 [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n\nRoy Kiyooka\n00:27:02\nReads \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", part 11 [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n\nRoy Kiyooka\n00:27:26\nReads \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", part 12 [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:28:06\nReads \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", part 13 [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:28:36\nReads \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", part 14 [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:29:21\nReads \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", part 15 [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:30:05\nThe last one in this section.\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:30:11\nReads \"The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight\", part 16 [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:30:53\nThere's a terrible draft coming in from the back, I think you're right Dick, we're going to end up with arthritic ankles. Well, this is the second section, and it is called \"The Proposal\". Once more, prefaced with a remark from Stanley Spencer, a very beautiful one. They are set down, as I found them in the book, I have used them in the context of this section of the book and these four poems, taken from his writings are meant to define certain of her attributes. Now I have given a title to each one of these four poems, and I hope they will clarify the context in which they belong here. \"Portrait of the Beloved\".\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:32:06\nReads \"Portrait of the Beloved\" [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:32:56\nThis I called \"The Marriage\".\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:33:05\nReads \"The Marriage\" [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:33:37\nThis is called \"The Separation\".\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:33:45\nReads \"The Separation\" [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:34:07\nAnd this, is \"Her Apotheosis\".\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:34:17\nReads \"Her Apotheosis\" [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:35:23\nThat incidentally, is a description he wrote to a friend about a painting that he in fact had made.

In 1958 he was a recipient of the Academy of American Poets [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q282096] Prize, and over a period of several years published his poems in the Harvard Advocate. He has given readings in Cambridge [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q49111], Minneapolis [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q36091], and in Oslo [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q585]. Also, he does not want me to mention his scholarly publications: Dash, Which Are, Strangers and Pilgrims, an essay on the Metaphor of the Journey written with Georg Roppen [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q23944662] and published by the Humanities Press [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q97958829] in New York City, as well as by the Norwegian University's Press, in Norway [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q20] and A Monograph, the Odyssey and Primitive Religion, published by the University of Bergen [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q204457] in 1962. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Dick Sommer.\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:01:02\nI didn't want him to mention those. Oh I've got the deal with Roy, as well. So this is a haiku with, which you'll be glad to know also has seventeen syllables in the title. \"The Haiku to Roy Kiyooka\", in reply to his haiku to me.\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:01:31\nReads \"The Haiku to Roy Kiyooka\".\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:01:50\nAnd this is the Haiku that began the mess, this was the one that I originally threatened to read to him, and naturally will carry out my threat. Which has a slightly different title, \"Haiku at Roy Kiyooka\"\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:02:07\nReads \"Haiku at Roy Kiyooka\".\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:02:27\nAnd then there's the one that I think you have on that broadsheet, which as I looked at it, in all of its mimeographed splendor, struck me as sounding a bit, now, like the theme song of the Central Intelligence Agency [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q37230], but I'm sorry about that, I didn't mean it that way when I wrote it.\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:02:55\nReads unnamed haiku.\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:03:13\nI'm as you've heard, I'm responsible for having written some criticism, sorry about that, but I hope to make it up with the next poem, which is also on your broadsheet. Called the meaning of- \"The Meaning of Poetry\".\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:03:36\nReads \"The Meaning of Poetry\".\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:04:19\nAnd this next poem, you'll be very happy to know I have my wife's permission to read.\n\nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:04:26\nReads unnamed poem.\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:05:02\nYou're going to be out of luck if you don't play chess, for this next one. You may be out of luck if you do, but that has more to do with the poem than your ability at chess.\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:05:23\nReads unnamed poem. \n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:06:27\nRoy's given us a series of poems in praise of 'her', I don't know who 'her' is, but I have another name for her myself, she's called the Lady of Situations, and that's the title of this poem. You know, situations in the sense of she's always getting involved, or people are always getting involved. This is that Lady of Situation. And, oh yes, there's some erudition in this one too, there's a marvelous drawing taken from the tomb of Tuthmosis [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1320491], which appears in the Skera, Egyptian Painting Volume, and you might look it up because she appears there as a tree, a breasted tree, and giving suck to a Pharaoh, it's quite interesting as a painting, anyway, that's in here too.\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:07:34\nReads \"Lady of Situation\".\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:09:29\nThe, I noticed that the Brotherhood of Railroad Engineers has arranged to have separate drinking glasses, or they're trying to get themselves put into the sanitary code, I think this is Roy's. This must be mine, still water. This next one, I wrote the day following my seeing of a movie that I hope many of you are familiar with, it's the Russian version of Don Quixote [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q49612156], a lovely film, beautiful adaptation of the myth of Don Quixote, and Sancho Panza [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q630823] in the terms of the revolution to come, and I was particularly fascinated to the title that was given to Don Quixote, in this film, so I used it for the title of the poem.\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:10:54\nReads \"Don Quixote de la Manchesky\".\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:13:25\nThis next one takes its title, this is another area of that reference, takes its title from a little known and very important folk ballad, I had to put something in ethnic here, so this is it. It's, the title is \"The Other Side of the Mountain\", and it comes from that little song that begins \"The bear climbed over the mountain to see what he could see, but the other side of the mountain was all that he could see\".\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:14:05\nReads \"The Other Side of the Mountain\".\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:17:15\nIncidentally, you must not get the idea that the mountain, you know, came entirely from the, from the, from the song. It, you can find it on the Greater Barrington Quadrangle, for the appropriate section of the Massachusetts [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q771] of the US [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30] geological survey, it's right on the map. It's really there, it's got position. This poem is in four sections, there are three narrative sections and then there's a short epilogue. And it's called \"My Loveliest Enemies\". I don't think there's any point in keeping you in suspense about this, my loveliest enemies are birds. And that's the punchline, so now you know it and you can listen to the poem.\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:18:24\nReads \"My Loveliest Enemies\" [parts 1-3].\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:33:12\nAnd here's the epilogue.\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:33:19\nReads \"Epilogue\" of \"My Loveliest Enemies\".\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:35:52\nIt's a race against not time but against the creeping gelatination, I think is the word of my lower extremities, and I'm sure the creeping sleepiness that is likely to affect you. This next, excuse me, here's to you! This next poem requires an erudite explanation too and I'm sorry for that. I hope, actually, it's not necessary. Alcuin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q154332], the Charles the King, Alcuin was an 8th century scholar who was brought from his, from the York [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q42462] diocese, to the court of Charlemagne [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3044], and there became the principal architect of Charlemagne's attempt to bring Latin and Latin culture to the Francs. You might say, I suppose, that he was the first of, first great humanist, but we'll see what his Latin is worth in this poem. This is a letter, written by Alcuin, actually it was written by me, presumably written by Alcuin, to Charles the King.\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:37:33\nReads \"Letter written by Alcuin, to Charles the King\".\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:41:46\nAnd this poem is, has a title, and a subtitle. The title is \"Concentration\" the subtitle, \"Homage to Eva Jerome\".\n\nEND\n00:42:12\n[Cut off abruptly].",

[Audience laughter and applause]...Well, glad to see y\u2019all here. So, Professor Louis Dudek []https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3261787] from McGill University [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q201492] will introduce the two poets who\u2019re reading this evening. \n\nAudience\n00:00:31\nApplause.\n\nLouis Dudek\n00:00:40\nI expected a longer introduction than that, it will be very fine. There are two kinds of readings that I like to attend very much, one kind is the sort that they're having tonight at McGill University, where a well-established poet who has been on the scene for forty or fifty years comes to read. Over there, it's A.J.M. Smith [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4647944] from Michigan State [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q270222], Canadian anthologist and well-known poet. With a poet like that, really makes no difference what he reads or how he reads it's just important to see him and even the tottering saint can perform miracles on occasions. The other kinds of poets I do like to hear very much are the sort that we'll hear tonight, Gnarowski and Beissel [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1606507]. The McGill publicity department sent out a notice about A.J.M. Smith and described him as well-known Anthropologist of Canadian poetry. Actually, they corrected it in ink, they made the mistake twice though, probably a typist error. But they didn't know how correct they were, with the current scene in Canadian writing, there are primitive types around that are hard to classify and we need anthropologists...Well, Beissel and Gnarowski are not of this breed of poets who seem to have lost all sense of poetic organization or form, where you think that conventions, poetic conventions have been abolished and what is left are chaotic bits of internal monologue on the page. Of course, that kind of school may be very interesting to watch to see what comes out of it but at present, having watched it now for a few years I'm a little impatient often and tired of the magazines where this material occurs because it seems so easy to turn out and anyone has these bits of chaotic monologue going on. On the other hand, there are many poets still writing who are not following the conventional forms of English metrics and rhyme and so forth, who are turning out poems or at least watching what happens what happens with the words on the page and both the poets we're listening to tonight are of this kind. They are very careful craftsmen. Henry Beissel has the long list of achievements to his credits already, but two on that list strike me very much. One is, amongst many of the posts where he's taught, one is the University of Alberta [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q640694] is the kind of political stir that was created on the campus when his magazine Edge was brought into the classroom by one of the professors. That is, his poetry contains, content that can make one think, that is morally committed to certain issues in today's world. He's very strongly a moral poet on one side, and the other item in his biography is his new book which has just appeared New Wings for Icarus, which is extremely aesthetic at the same time that it is meaningful in this way. His poetry seems to combine two things, one is a moral urgency and on the other hand, at the same time, a romantic sense of language and of imagery and of emotion that goes with that, which are all very, very promising characteristics for a beginning poet, but I think that this New Wings for Icarus book is his first considerable book. So, without more ado, I introduce to you Henry Beissel. \n\nHenry Beissel\n00:05:30\nWhen I considered the kind of poems that I might read this evening and the order in which to read them, I was thinking of the condition of this hall, as it was the last time I was here and I therefore chose two poems which I wrote in the West Indies [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q669037]. [Audience laughter]. They celebrate the sun in an ambiguous sort of way, I'm going to read them all the same, despite the fact that the conditions have changed. I don't know how much you need to know about the West Indies, I'm hoping\u2014oh.\n\nAudience Member 1\n00:06:15\nAddresses Beissel [unintelligible].\n\nHenry Beissel\n00:06:17\nIs this any better? Is there someone in the hall who can attend please to all this? \n\nAudience Member 2\n00:06:28\nAddresses Beissel [unintelligible].\n\nAudience\n00:06:30\nLaughter.\n\nHenry Beissel\n00:06:39\nWell I'll try to speak a little louder on my own, in spite of the microphone. I was saying that I don't know how much one needs to know of the West Indies to respond to this sort of poem, I'm hoping something of the West Indies might be in the poems, the first is called \"Pans at Carnival\". Pan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6610630] is the expression for a steel drum. The imagery in the poem is taken entirely from the steel drum and its use at Carnival [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4618], a feast that is about to be celebrated in Trinidad [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q754] in about a month. Rhythmically, the poem tries to catch something of the rhythm of the steel pan. \n\nHenry Beissel\n00:07:28\nReads \"Pans at Carnival\".\n\nHenry Beissel\n00:10:18\nThe second poem celebrates something of the violence that the sun, with which the sun blesses those parts of the world from which it never really disappears.\n\nHenry Beissel\n00:10:34\nReads \"Where the Sun Only\".\n\nHenry Beissel\n00:12:49\nNext I want to read two parts from New Wings for Icarus. Time does not allow me to read the whole poem, because then I could read you nothing else. \u201cIcarus\u201d is a poem that is written in four parts, it is with some regret that I read only two, because to me it is like playing the second and fourth part of a symphony, but there is no alternative. \n\nHenry Beissel\n00:13:19\nReads \"New Wings for Icarus\", part 2 from New Wings for Icarus.\n\nHenry Beissel\n00:13:51\nSorry, I'll start again. This is a hard one to read and this print is very small. I better hold it closer.\n\nHenry Beissel\n00:13:59\nReads \"New Wings for Icarus\", part 2 from New Wings for Icarus.\n\nHenry Beissel\n00:19:41\nReads \"New Wings for Icarus\", part 4 from New Wings for Icarus.\n\nHenry Beissel\n00:26:39\nNow for a little sort of relaxation in-between, I find unrelieved serious poetry hard to bear myself, I'll read\u2014unfortunately I do not write occasional poems terribly often, they always seem to grow into something much bigger than I can handle, but the next two poems I want to read you are occasional poems, poetry can come out of anything of course, and this one came out of an encounter in a house of Inquisition in Cartagena [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q657461], in Colombia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q739], it is really self-explanatory. It's called \"En la Casa de Inquisici\u00f3n\". \n\nHenry Beissel\n00:27:40\nReads \"En la Casa de Inquisici\u00f3n\".\n\nHenry Beissel\n00:29:23\nThe next poem leads me on to the last set of poems, but you won't discover that until you hear the last two poems. This poem is dedicated to my daughter, when she was 1 and a half, the first stanza deals with the circumstances of her birth, which were somewhat elaborate, there were firemen. The second stanza deals with her present\u2014this would be the past from the time of the poem, the second deals with her present, and the third with her future. \n\nHenry Beissel\n00:30:07\nReads \"To My Daughter at Age 1 1\/2\".\n\nHenry Beissel\n00:33:25\nAnd now I come to the final two poems. They belong together and are part of a\u2014 we agreed not to torture you and not to read for more than 30 minutes this evening and I am trying to stick to that. This is rather the beginning of something that I may never live to finish, the entire thing is supposed to have some 26 poems, of which you will hear the first two, one is a prologue and the other one is called \"Adam Enter Eve\". In the prologue, a character introduces himself who is to play his part in the rest of the poem. It's not really a dramatic poem, although it's, well I don't think of it as a drama, although it has dramatic qualities. Anyway, I don't like to be my own critic. I prefer just to read you the poem. The whole cycle will be called \"The Dancer from the Dance\" that is as you no doubt know, a quotation from Yeats [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q40213]. \n\nHenry Beissel\n00:34:45\nReads \"Prologue\" from \"The Dancer from the Dance\".\n\nHenry Beissel\n00:37:04\nReads \"Adam Enter Eve\".\n\nEND\n00:49:40\n[Recording continues on mike_gnarowski_i006-11-122.mp3].\n\nmike_gnarowski_i006-11-122.mp3 [File 2 of 2]\n\nLouis Dudek\n00:00:00\nStrongly I was impressed and moved by that reading by Henry Beissel. Really several times after the poems I wanted to applaud, only we don't do that. They were magnificently organized forms with powerful language and very well read, I felt, I think I'm speaking for most people here when I say that. Mike Gnarowski who reads next is different perhaps in the extent to which his poetry is oriented towards reality. Not by implication because Beissel's also is very real and very down to earth and very much committed to the real world, but Gnarowski's poetry has a lot to do with Canadian poetry and the way it has turned towards the real world since about 1925 since A.J.M. Smith and Scott [F.R. Scott; https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3081656] and A.M. Klein [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2778027] began writing. Gnarowski's been very active as a student of Canadian literature, a scholar and a bibliographer and so forth of our literature looking into the sources of this modern poetry and to letters and documents. In this he has done some very valuable work, indexing little magazines that would be otherwise, less well known, preparing bibliographies and he is now working on a larger anthology of criticism introducing the backgrounds of modern Canadian poetry. All this kind of study which is very valuable on the academic side is also important to his poetry I feel, that it places him within the line of modern Canadian poets who have tried to interpret the real, the visible, the actual, directly in poetry. Somewhat in the way I suppose that all modern poetry in English does, including T.S. Eliot's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q37767] \"Waste Land\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q581458] and Ezra Pound's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q163366] \"Cantos\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2701465] and e. e. cumming's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q298703] comedies and satires and Auden's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q178698] poetry also. That is the characteristic of twentieth-century poetry is that its extreme realism and the bringing of the romantic conceptions of the last century to bear upon the actual world and showing that the conflict, the intense conflict that exists in the poet between his conception of things and what he sees before him. That you find in Gnarowski very much. He as a writer he is a meticulous craftsman, I don't know if that's symbolic [audience laughter]... He's also a meticulous craftsman and his poems seem to grow by accretion, very gradually. He writes with a stubborn integrity and knows what he thinks and what he's trying to say in a poem, they aren't just momentary fusions. They're highly worked up pieces of writing. There's a strong element of rationality and reality in this poetry, less of the flight of the emotions and the fantasy that's in most other poets. There's a very strong formal organization in his poetry, a clean speech, straight as the Greeks as Ezra Pound used to say in the past. His first book is entitled Postscript for St. James Street which has to do with, in some part anyhow, with the business world in which we live and he has chosen that quite consciously as a subject that could be turned into poetry, to take the business man, the real in that sense, St. James Street [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1526237] and see what can be made out of that imaginatively. Most poets when they treat a subject like that turn it into satire, because what else can you make out of St. James Street, but Gnarowski wants to keep his vision clear and straight for the fact to see what it really is without elevating too much or perhaps without caricaturing the reality, and it's a very interesting experiment. I'm sure you'll all enjoy listening to his poetry.\n \nMike Gnarowski\n00:05:09\nA couple of years ago I had the occasion to go up into North Western Ontario [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1904], and I lived there for three or four years and more specifically on Port Arthur [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7230482] which is on the very shores of Lake Superior [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1066], and I kept looking at this magnificent and fantastic lake and it kept bothering me. It was too big and too vast and too meaningful and too ominous in many ways to be let off too easily. I also had a friend up there who was an anthropologist and archaeologist and a very good one, and he spent a lot of time going up into that country up around Lake Superior and he kept coming back with all sorts of wonderful thing, all sorts of relics of the past as it were. Gaffs and skulls and this and that which he kept finding and he told me that that part of the world had at one time had supported a pretty fantastic civilization of its own, a very peculiar civilization. And I looked at the lake, Lake Superior, and I decided I would try to write something about it, about the feelings that I think that this ominous body of water might have. A little poem I did for it is entitled \"Great Sea\".\n \nMike Gnarowski\n00:06:30\nReads \"Great Sea\".\n \nMike Gnarowski\n00:10:40\nAnd following along the same themes, a little poem entitled \"Amethyst Harbour\" which was occasioned by a visit of A.Y. Jackson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3499926] and several friends who gathered in this quite magnificent place on the lake, just about this time of the year and you could look out across Thunder Bay [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q9298873] and you saw nothing but ice-locked island and of course snow and ice continuing forever and ever. I always felt the nature, of course, there had not been overcome by man and that nature always threatened man and that there was a struggle, a conflict, a tension going on. So here is \"Amethyst Harbour\".\n \nMike Gnarowski\n00:11:31\nReads \"Amethyst Harbour\".\n \nMike Gnarowski\n00:13:20\nAs Louis Dudek pointed out, I've always been fascinated by those men who wheel and deal and who are responsible for much of the life of the nation, I suppose, of North America [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q49], the so-called businessman, much maligned most of the time. I normally try to deal as properly as I can and in this instance I think I'm probably being unkind. This is a poem entitled \"Portrait of a Man Come to Say Farewell\".\n \nMike Gnarowski\n00:13:55\nReads \"Portrait of a Man Come to Say Farewell\".\n\nAudience\n00:15:26\nApplause [one person].\n \nMike Gnarowski\n00:15:30\nUhh--Thank you. A little while ago, or a few years ago I should say, I had the occasion to go to a town south-east of here called Victoriaville [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q141731], I was there on business and I went through an old-age or an old-people's home and some of you may know what those places are like, I was profoundly affected by this experience and I tried to write something about it and I've called this little thing \"Provincia Nostra\".\n \nMike Gnarowski\n00:15:56\nReads \"Provincia Nostra\u201d.\n \nMike Gnarowski\n00:16:50\nThis is for a friend who was lost in an automobile accident.\n \nMike Gnarowski\n00:16:54\nReads unnamed poem.\n \nMike Gnarowski\n00:17:31\nA very short thing, which I think fills the purpose of keeping me from becoming too serious.\n \nMike Gnarowski\n00:17:46\nReads unnamed poem. \n\nMike Gnarowski\n00:17:59\nThank you.\n \nAudience\n00:18:00\nLaughter and applause [cut off].\n\nIntroducer\n00:18:03\nWe'd like to express our thanks to Mike Gnarowski, Henry Beissel, and our special appreciation to Louis Dudek who made the supreme sacrifice of tearing himself away from McGill to come here and introduce them. [Audience applause]. Our next reading will be in two weeks, on Friday, January 27 Margaret Avison [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6759152] will be coming from Toronto [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q172] to read her poetry and the following reading on Sat. Feb. 11, Paul Blackburn [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7149388] who is the Poet in Residence at the City College in New York [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1093910] and the author of, among other things, Brooklyn, Manhattan Transit will be coming here to read his poetry. Thank you.\n \nEND\n00:19:00\n"

While at McGill, he published his poetry in Yes, which he co-edited. Gnarowski was heavily involved in several presses and magazines throughout his career, which include Le Chien d\u2019or\/The Golden Dog, Delta, Golden Dog Press, the Tecumseh Press, Arc Poetry Magazine and McGraw-Hill Ryerson\u2019s Critical Views on Canadian Writers Series (Ryerson Press, 1970), and Canadian Poetry. Along with Ron Everson, Raymond Souster and Louis Dudek, he founded the League of Canadian Poets in 1966. He taught English at the University of Sherbrooke from 1961-62; at Port Arthur (now Thunder Bay), Ontario from 1962-65; was an assistant professor of English at Sir George Williams University (now Concordia) from 1966-72; Carleton University from 1972 onwards.

Really several times after the poems I wanted to applaud, only we don't do that. They were magnificently organized forms with powerful language and very well read, I felt, I think I'm speaking for most people here when I say that. Mike Gnarowski who reads next is different perhaps in the extent to which his poetry is oriented towards reality. Not by implication because Beissel's also is very real and very down to earth and very much committed to the real world, but Gnarowski's poetry has a lot to do with Canadian poetry and the way it has turned towards the real world since about 1925 since A.J.M. Smith and Scott [F.R. Scott; https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3081656] and A.M. Klein [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2778027] began writing. Gnarowski's been very active as a student of Canadian literature, a scholar and a bibliographer and so forth of our literature looking into the sources of this modern poetry and to letters and documents. In this he has done some very valuable work, indexing little magazines that would be otherwise, less well known, preparing bibliographies and he is now working on a larger anthology of criticism introducing the backgrounds of modern Canadian poetry. All this kind of study which is very valuable on the academic side is also important to his poetry I feel, that it places him within the line of modern Canadian poets who have tried to interpret the real, the visible, the actual, directly in poetry. Somewhat in the way I suppose that all modern poetry in English does, including T.S. Eliot's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q37767] \"Waste Land\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q581458] and Ezra Pound's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q163366] \"Cantos\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2701465] and e. e. cumming's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q298703] comedies and satires and Auden's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q178698] poetry also. That is the characteristic of twentieth-century poetry is that its extreme realism and the bringing of the romantic conceptions of the last century to bear upon the actual world and showing that the conflict, the intense conflict that exists in the poet between his conception of things and what he sees before him. That you find in Gnarowski very much. He as a writer he is a meticulous craftsman, I don't know if that's symbolic [audience laughter]... He's also a meticulous craftsman and his poems seem to grow by accretion, very gradually. He writes with a stubborn integrity and knows what he thinks and what he's trying to say in a poem, they aren't just momentary fusions. They're highly worked up pieces of writing. There's a strong element of rationality and reality in this poetry, less of the flight of the emotions and the fantasy that's in most other poets. There's a very strong formal organization in his poetry, a clean speech, straight as the Greeks as Ezra Pound used to say in the past. His first book is entitled Postscript for St. James Street which has to do with, in some part anyhow, with the business world in which we live and he has chosen that quite consciously as a subject that could be turned into poetry, to take the business man, the real in that sense, St. James Street [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1526237] and see what can be made out of that imaginatively. Most poets when they treat a subject like that turn it into satire, because what else can you make out of St. James Street, but Gnarowski wants to keep his vision clear and straight for the fact to see what it really is without elevating too much or perhaps without caricaturing the reality, and it's a very interesting experiment. I'm sure you'll all enjoy listening to his poetry.\n \nMike Gnarowski\n00:05:09\nA couple of years ago I had the occasion to go up into North Western Ontario [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1904], and I lived there for three or four years and more specifically on Port Arthur [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7230482] which is on the very shores of Lake Superior [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1066], and I kept looking at this magnificent and fantastic lake and it kept bothering me. It was too big and too vast and too meaningful and too ominous in many ways to be let off too easily. I also had a friend up there who was an anthropologist and archaeologist and a very good one, and he spent a lot of time going up into that country up around Lake Superior and he kept coming back with all sorts of wonderful thing, all sorts of relics of the past as it were. Gaffs and skulls and this and that which he kept finding and he told me that that part of the world had at one time had supported a pretty fantastic civilization of its own, a very peculiar civilization. And I looked at the lake, Lake Superior, and I decided I would try to write something about it, about the feelings that I think that this ominous body of water might have. A little poem I did for it is entitled \"Great Sea\".\n \nMike Gnarowski\n00:06:30\nReads \"Great Sea\".\n \nMike Gnarowski\n00:10:40\nAnd following along the same themes, a little poem entitled \"Amethyst Harbour\" which was occasioned by a visit of A.Y. Jackson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3499926] and several friends who gathered in this quite magnificent place on the lake, just about this time of the year and you could look out across Thunder Bay [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q9298873] and you saw nothing but ice-locked island and of course snow and ice continuing forever and ever. I always felt the nature, of course, there had not been overcome by man and that nature always threatened man and that there was a struggle, a conflict, a tension going on.

I normally try to deal as properly as I can and in this instance I think I'm probably being unkind. This is a poem entitled \"Portrait of a Man Come to Say Farewell\".\n \nMike Gnarowski\n00:13:55\nReads \"Portrait of a Man Come to Say Farewell\".\n\nAudience\n00:15:26\nApplause [one person].\n \nMike Gnarowski\n00:15:30\nUhh--Thank you. A little while ago, or a few years ago I should say, I had the occasion to go to a town south-east of here called Victoriaville [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q141731], I was there on business and I went through an old-age or an old-people's home and some of you may know what those places are like, I was profoundly affected by this experience and I tried to write something about it and I've called this little thing \"Provincia Nostra\".\n \nMike Gnarowski\n00:15:56\nReads \"Provincia Nostra\u201d.\n \nMike Gnarowski\n00:16:50\nThis is for a friend who was lost in an automobile accident.\n \nMike Gnarowski\n00:16:54\nReads unnamed poem.\n \nMike Gnarowski\n00:17:31\nA very short thing, which I think fills the purpose of keeping me from becoming too serious.\n \nMike Gnarowski\n00:17:46\nReads unnamed poem. \n\nMike Gnarowski\n00:17:59\nThank you.\n \nAudience\n00:18:00\nLaughter and applause [cut off].\n\nIntroducer\n00:18:03\nWe'd like to express our thanks to Mike Gnarowski, Henry Beissel, and our special appreciation to Louis Dudek who made the supreme sacrifice of tearing himself away from McGill to come here and introduce them. [Audience applause]. Our next reading will be in two weeks, on Friday, January 27 Margaret Avison [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6759152] will be coming from Toronto [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q172] to read her poetry and the following reading on Sat. Feb. 11, Paul Blackburn [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7149388] who is the Poet in Residence at the City College in New York [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1093910] and the author of, among other things, Brooklyn, Manhattan Transit will be coming here to read his poetry.

[Audience laughter and applause]...Well, glad to see y\u2019all here. So, Professor Louis Dudek []https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3261787] from McGill University [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q201492] will introduce the two poets who\u2019re reading this evening. \n\nAudience\n00:00:31\nApplause.\n\nLouis Dudek\n00:00:40\nI expected a longer introduction than that, it will be very fine. There are two kinds of readings that I like to attend very much, one kind is the sort that they're having tonight at McGill University, where a well-established poet who has been on the scene for forty or fifty years comes to read. Over there, it's A.J.M. Smith [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4647944] from Michigan State [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q270222], Canadian anthologist and well-known poet. With a poet like that, really makes no difference what he reads or how he reads it's just important to see him and even the tottering saint can perform miracles on occasions. The other kinds of poets I do like to hear very much are the sort that we'll hear tonight, Gnarowski and Beissel [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1606507]. The McGill publicity department sent out a notice about A.J.M. Smith and described him as well-known Anthropologist of Canadian poetry. Actually, they corrected it in ink, they made the mistake twice though, probably a typist error. But they didn't know how correct they were, with the current scene in Canadian writing, there are primitive types around that are hard to classify and we need anthropologists...Well, Beissel and Gnarowski are not of this breed of poets who seem to have lost all sense of poetic organization or form, where you think that conventions, poetic conventions have been abolished and what is left are chaotic bits of internal monologue on the page. Of course, that kind of school may be very interesting to watch to see what comes out of it but at present, having watched it now for a few years I'm a little impatient often and tired of the magazines where this material occurs because it seems so easy to turn out and anyone has these bits of chaotic monologue going on. On the other hand, there are many poets still writing who are not following the conventional forms of English metrics and rhyme and so forth, who are turning out poems or at least watching what happens what happens with the words on the page and both the poets we're listening to tonight are of this kind. They are very careful craftsmen. Henry Beissel has the long list of achievements to his credits already, but two on that list strike me very much. One is, amongst many of the posts where he's taught, one is the University of Alberta [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q640694] is the kind of political stir that was created on the campus when his magazine Edge was brought into the classroom by one of the professors. That is, his poetry contains, content that can make one think, that is morally committed to certain issues in today's world. He's very strongly a moral poet on one side, and the other item in his biography is his new book which has just appeared New Wings for Icarus, which is extremely aesthetic at the same time that it is meaningful in this way. His poetry seems to combine two things, one is a moral urgency and on the other hand, at the same time, a romantic sense of language and of imagery and of emotion that goes with that, which are all very, very promising characteristics for a beginning poet, but I think that this New Wings for Icarus book is his first considerable book. So, without more ado, I introduce to you Henry Beissel. \n\nHenry Beissel\n00:05:30\nWhen I considered the kind of poems that I might read this evening and the order in which to read them, I was thinking of the condition of this hall, as it was the last time I was here and I therefore chose two poems which I wrote in the West Indies [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q669037]. [Audience laughter]. They celebrate the sun in an ambiguous sort of way, I'm going to read them all the same, despite the fact that the conditions have changed. I don't know how much you need to know about the West Indies, I'm hoping\u2014oh.\n\nAudience Member 1\n00:06:15\nAddresses Beissel [unintelligible].\n\nHenry Beissel\n00:06:17\nIs this any better? Is there someone in the hall who can attend please to all this? \n\nAudience Member 2\n00:06:28\nAddresses Beissel [unintelligible].\n\nAudience\n00:06:30\nLaughter.\n\nHenry Beissel\n00:06:39\nWell I'll try to speak a little louder on my own, in spite of the microphone. I was saying that I don't know how much one needs to know of the West Indies to respond to this sort of poem, I'm hoping something of the West Indies might be in the poems, the first is called \"Pans at Carnival\". Pan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6610630] is the expression for a steel drum. The imagery in the poem is taken entirely from the steel drum and its use at Carnival [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4618], a feast that is about to be celebrated in Trinidad [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q754] in about a month. Rhythmically, the poem tries to catch something of the rhythm of the steel pan. \n\nHenry Beissel\n00:07:28\nReads \"Pans at Carnival\".\n\nHenry Beissel\n00:10:18\nThe second poem celebrates something of the violence that the sun, with which the sun blesses those parts of the world from which it never really disappears.\n\nHenry Beissel\n00:10:34\nReads \"Where the Sun Only\".\n\nHenry Beissel\n00:12:49\nNext I want to read two parts from New Wings for Icarus. Time does not allow me to read the whole poem, because then I could read you nothing else. \u201cIcarus\u201d is a poem that is written in four parts, it is with some regret that I read only two, because to me it is like playing the second and fourth part of a symphony, but there is no alternative. \n\nHenry Beissel\n00:13:19\nReads \"New Wings for Icarus\", part 2 from New Wings for Icarus.\n\nHenry Beissel\n00:13:51\nSorry, I'll start again. This is a hard one to read and this print is very small. I better hold it closer.\n\nHenry Beissel\n00:13:59\nReads \"New Wings for Icarus\", part 2 from New Wings for Icarus.\n\nHenry Beissel\n00:19:41\nReads \"New Wings for Icarus\", part 4 from New Wings for Icarus.\n\nHenry Beissel\n00:26:39\nNow for a little sort of relaxation in-between, I find unrelieved serious poetry hard to bear myself, I'll read\u2014unfortunately I do not write occasional poems terribly often, they always seem to grow into something much bigger than I can handle, but the next two poems I want to read you are occasional poems, poetry can come out of anything of course, and this one came out of an encounter in a house of Inquisition in Cartagena [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q657461], in Colombia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q739], it is really self-explanatory. It's called \"En la Casa de Inquisici\u00f3n\". \n\nHenry Beissel\n00:27:40\nReads \"En la Casa de Inquisici\u00f3n\".\n\nHenry Beissel\n00:29:23\nThe next poem leads me on to the last set of poems, but you won't discover that until you hear the last two poems. This poem is dedicated to my daughter, when she was 1 and a half, the first stanza deals with the circumstances of her birth, which were somewhat elaborate, there were firemen. The second stanza deals with her present\u2014this would be the past from the time of the poem, the second deals with her present, and the third with her future. \n\nHenry Beissel\n00:30:07\nReads \"To My Daughter at Age 1 1\/2\".\n\nHenry Beissel\n00:33:25\nAnd now I come to the final two poems. They belong together and are part of a\u2014 we agreed not to torture you and not to read for more than 30 minutes this evening and I am trying to stick to that. This is rather the beginning of something that I may never live to finish, the entire thing is supposed to have some 26 poems, of which you will hear the first two, one is a prologue and the other one is called \"Adam Enter Eve\". In the prologue, a character introduces himself who is to play his part in the rest of the poem. It's not really a dramatic poem, although it's, well I don't think of it as a drama, although it has dramatic qualities. Anyway, I don't like to be my own critic. I prefer just to read you the poem. The whole cycle will be called \"The Dancer from the Dance\" that is as you no doubt know, a quotation from Yeats [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q40213]. \n\nHenry Beissel\n00:34:45\nReads \"Prologue\" from \"The Dancer from the Dance\".\n\nHenry Beissel\n00:37:04\nReads \"Adam Enter Eve\".\n\nEND\n00:49:40\n[Recording continues on mike_gnarowski_i006-11-122.mp3].\n",

Well, this is our seventh poetry evening and we welcome you all here this cold and blustery evening. Now, this evening we're having Margaret Avison [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6759152] read poems, and I wanted to say a few things about her. I first listened to Margaret read her poems at the poetry conference, University of British Columbia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q391028], during the summer of 1963. Her reading, together with those of the other poets on hand, are among the most memorable occasions I've had in my love affair with poems and poets. Four years later, in early January, we spent an afternoon together. Now I don't want to attribute, what I felt with a thought, on Bloor Street, to our conversation, but the warmth of it was very real. Margaret Avison was born in Guelph [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q504114], Ontario [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1904]; some early years were spent in Alberta [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1951]; she graduated from Victoria College [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3551503], the University of Toronto [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q180865], in 1940, with a BA in English Language and Literature. She has been a secretary of all sorts for various firms, individuals, and organizations, and has also been a research assistant and librarian and presently teaches English at Scarborough College, Toronto [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q172]. 1956-57 she was a Guggenheim Fellow [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Property:P6594] in poetry, and during the forties her work appeared in various Canadian magazines, and in the fifties, mainly in American ones. She has published two books of poems; The Winter Sun in 1960 won the Governor General's Award [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q283256], and in 1966, W.W. Norton [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1282208] in New York [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60] issued The Dumbfounding [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q42189162], her latest book. Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure in introducing to you Margaret Avison.\n \nUnknown\n00:02:59\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed]. \n \nMargaret Avison\n00:02:59\nI don't know about the reading but I do know about the pleasure of meeting Roy [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3445789] again here, and being introduced by him. If this were Monday, or up to a week from tonight, I would be able to join the Angry Art Week. I don't know if anybody else has received these letters, but in New York City initially they're trying this and anybody who gets a letter from them is asked to dedicate any reading or event to what they're trying to do. You can still send them money, too, I'll give you the address if you want it later. What they're going to do is play harps in railroad stations and have...lets see, Bach [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1339] cantatas in railroad stations, play-ins in various museums and the lobbies of concert halls, recital halls, business buildings--I like that one--dramatic presentations in laundromats and supermarkets, [audience laughter], a paint-in, and fences and billboards throughout Manhattan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q11299] with their work showing and so on. This is a series. \"What we're trying to do is through art to reach the American people as human beings.\" So...[audience laughter]. If this were Monday I'd dedicate the reading [audience laughter and applause]...This is all very orderly, although it doesn't look it, and it starts with other people's poems of various kinds. A little section of C. Bukowski [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q76409], somebody said that's Charles, an American poet. It's a great long thing that was in a mimeograph magazine, and the description is of a woman with a bicycle and a baby carriage, high-heeled shoes, white socks, and all her belongings, on a hot day in the middle of a road in a city. \n \nMargaret Avison\n00:05:28\nReads unnamed poem by Charles Bukowski.\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:06:30.\nThat's sad, so on the same page I copied one of Al Fowler's, which was in a magazine called Lines, which is the all-time happiest little poem, and I don't know why. I'm going to stop where the lines stop, not where the sense stops, so you can see the shape of it.  There's no capital letters. There's no title.\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:07:01\nReads \u201cAre you a root or a tendermint\u201d by Al Fowler [published in Lines 6].\n\nAudience \n00:07:20\nLaughter.\n\nMargaret Avison\n00:07:30\nThis is one by Gerry Gilbert [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5552756], called \"Zoo\".\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:07:39\nReads \"Zoo\" by Gerry Gilbert.\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:08:00\nI may bring in some more of other people's, but this is just a little, it's a friend of mine in Toronto who's made it to grade seven this year. He calls it \"The Delinquent\", and he has, in this copy he has said that it's his copyright so if you betray the fact that I read some of it, I'll be in trouble with him.\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:08:33\nReads \"The Delinquent\" by an unnamed author [audience laughter throughout].\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:10:20\nIt goes on, a bit, I want to go back to where it gets sad, though. I love \"She twisted her pinkies behind her but all the knots held more\".\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:10:30\nResumes reading \"The Delinquent\" [audience laughter throughout].\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:11:33\nThere's an awful line in the next verse. [Audience laughter].\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:11:41\nResumes reading \"The Delinquent\" [audience laughter throughout].\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:12:43\nIt ends up with knotting a burning matchstick into her old man's hair. [Audience laughter]. I think as he goes on he'll be somebody. If I'm not reading mine I'll warn of you. Some of these...the first one is a Toronto poem with footnotes, saying that TTC [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q17978] means Toronto Transit Commission, and the Ditch is an open cut on the Yonge subway between Bloor and Rosedale. \n \nMargaret Avison\n00:13:38\nReads unnamed poem.\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:14:37\nThe second subway poem...a little child, it's called \"Subway Station Why Not.\"\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:14:53\nReads \"Subway Station Why Not\".\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:15:56\nThis next one is St. Clair Avenue, where I live on the car tracks. It's called \"Insomniac Report\".\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:16:11\nReads \"Insomniac Report\".\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:17:07\nFeels as if I should be doing something different, but I don't know what. I did a poem to people writing examinations I'm hunting for, but I think I've forgotten it. There's three about this odd experience of teaching and students. This one was written before I had had the experience, but was looking forward to it. And it had the title \"Is That You\/Me Standing on My\/Your Feet?\" And it's very full of fine theory and idealism.\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:18:18\nReads \"Is That You\/Me Standing on My\/Your Feet?\".\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:19:21\nAnd I've got two other incomplete ones that should be read with that. I'll just read two stanzas of the first one, it's got one four-line stanza for the students...\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:19:36\nReads unnamed poem.\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:20:36\nThe teacher's answer hasn't got written yet. Here's another bit, two stanzas, the student and the teacher, that isn't finished. The student is talking although it doesn't sound like it. \n \nMargaret Avison\n00:21:01\nReads unnamed poem.\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:21:51\nThere's a daybreak bus I have to catch and this one is called \"October 21, '66, at a bus stop on the way\".\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:22:03\nReads \"October 21, '66, at a bus stop on the way\".\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:23:07\nI had planned to get all this organized on the plane, but I was in the middle of the three seats and I kept getting the briefcase out and everything would fall to the floor, and this one would dive for it, or this one, and I finally gave up, so it's upside down. This is dedicated to Jacques Ellul [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q322922], The Technological Society [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1607727], a book he wrote that's a little mad but very stirring.\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:23:56\nReads [\u201cMaking Senses\u201d, published later in No Time]. \n \nMargaret Avison\n00:26:39\nThere's one here that is just the equivalent to sketching, I guess. I know a poet in Chicago [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1297] who used to go and sit around in the Art Institute [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q239303], when it was a fairly quiet room, and stare all morning, and if any words occurred to him, he dashed them down. And sometime he worked up his sketches and sometime he didn't, which is a technique that's lots of fun to practice, and occasionally something grows out of it. In this case I don't think I'll ever do anything but it'll show you the kind of thing that I mean, if, as I assume, most of you are writers.\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:27:38\nReads unnamed poem. \n \nMargaret Avison\n00:28:25\nNow a poem with syntax and stuff called \"The Seven Birds\". A corner of Bathurst and College Street in Toronto which is the kind of buildings that have been there since the first world war, where there's often stores on the street level and an apartment or two above. \n \nMargaret Avison\n00:29:01\nReads \"The Seven Birds\" [published later in sunblue].\n\nMargaret Avison\n00:30:15\nI think I should read a long, fierce poem. This is not by me except translated. It's the poem of Gyula Illyes [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q381107], called \"Of Tyranny, In One Breath\". Ilona Duczynska [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q967353] did a literal translation for me and then read it to me for sound and we worked through it that way.  Apparently the poem started, or happened, in 1956 in Budapest [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1781]. Illyes had written it some years before but hadn't been angry enough at the time to risk what it was to bring it out. But he grew angry enough and somebody said the one thing that nobody censors is the magazine which tells you what lectures are going on where and what movies are running where and is just a news sheet, and the middle spread was for advertising, so they printed this in the middle sheet and it was, they tried to stop it as soon as the authorities found it but by then they were storming the radio station or however it started. I can't do it in one breath because it goes on for several pages. In the first part of it, \"it,\" meaning \"tyranny\" is small \"i\" and towards the end it's a capital \"I.\"\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:32:27\nReads English translation of \"Of Tyranny, In One Breath\" by Gyula Illyes [published later in Always Now, Vol. 1].\n\nMargaret Avison\n00:39:26\nSo, after the revolution he was much too well-known to disappear but they said he was insane and he was in an asylum for a while, but he wrote a lot of lovely things there, so I don't think he was, and he's not there now. It's much better, I think. A group of silly things it's embarrassing to read but I will, called \"Bestialities\".\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:40:19\nReads \"Bestialities\", parts 1-5 [from The Dumbfounding; audience laughter throughout].\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:41:14\nThe last one I think is just beautiful, but nobody gets it unless I explain, so I'll explain, it's like you take a piece of 8 by 11 typing paper...\n \nAudience Member 1\n00:41:26\nDon't explain, just say it.\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:41:28\nAlright, you can tell me then, eh? \n \nMargaret Avison\n00:41:33\nReads \"Bestialities\", part 6 [from The Dumbfounding].\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:41:40\nNow, come on...[Audience laughter]. Hmm? Does anybody want the explanation? Well I've read it. It's just a crumpled-up letter, you know, you get it and you read it and you cry and you crumble it up and you throw it down and the mite goes up...Now I'll read it again.\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:42:17\nReads \"Bestialities\", part 6 [from The Dumbfounding].\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:42:35\n\u201cThe Absorbed\". This is one of the very cold days, I guess about ten below, enough. It's inside the pane of glass separating inside from outside comes into it, a certain kind of sky that goes with that which is like glass again. \n \nMargaret Avison\n00:43:09\nReads \"The Absorbed\" [from The Dumbfounding].\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:45:50\nReads [\"Thaw\" from Winter Sun].\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:47:37\nI would like to read two other weather ones and then I'll give you a break. This is \u201cTwo Mayday Selves\u201d.\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:47:54\nReads \"Two Mayday Selves\" [from The Dumbfounding].\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:49:42\nAnd the last one is late spring, early summer. Jet-plane and terminuses, called \"Black-White Under Green, May 18th 1965\u201d.\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:50:06\nReads \"Black-White Under Green, May 18th 1965\u201d [published as \u201cMay 18 1965\u201d in The Dumbfounding].\n\nUnknown\n00:52:53\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n\nMargaret Avison\n00:52:54\nI've been asked to read \"The Valiant Vacationist\". It was written so many years ago...I think I would be quite right in saying thirty years ago, and probably a little more. And I couldn't write this well now but in a way when you're very young you've got the whole world in one lump without any lump, and you only get bits later on. \n \nMargaret Avison\n00:53:34\nReads \"The Valiant Vacationist\" [published later in Always Now: Vol. 1].\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:56:54\nThen the one \"To Professor X, Year Y\".\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:57:03\nReads \"To Professor X, Year Y\" [from Winter Sun].\n\nMargaret Avison\n00:59:57\nI'd like to read one introductory poem to the long one, \"The Earth that Falls Away\", and that one, and two short ones, if you'll bear with me that long. This is called \"The Absolute, the Day\".\n \nMargaret Avison\n01:00:22\nReads \"The Absolute, the Day\" [published later as \u201cAbsolute\u201d in sunblue and in Always Now Vol. 2].\n\nMargaret Avison\n01:01:39\nThis one is \"The Earth that Falls Away\". There's an epigraph from Beddoes\u2019 [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2165597] Death's Jest-Book [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q42188673]: \"Can a man die? Aye, as the sun doth set, it is the earth that falls away from light\". There are a number of human situations, some into the past, through the present generation, the rest various city people, myself, and the stories come interleaving so that as I name a new section it'll be a new group of people, and by request I'm going to  stop at the line-ends here. \n \nMargaret Avison\n01:02:32\nReads \"The Earth that Falls Away\" [from The Dumbfounding].\n \nMargaret Avison\n01:15:52\nReads [\"He Couldn\u2019t Be Safe (Isaiah 53:5)\u201d, published later in sunblue].\n \nMargaret Avison\n01:16:54\nThere's one more and I'll stop with this one. \n \nMargaret Avison\n01:17:00\nReads [section from \u201cThe Jo Poems\u201d, part 6. Published later in No Time. Subtitled \u201cHaving\u201d in Always Now: Vol. 2].\n \nEND\n01:17:54\n[Cut off abruptly].\n"

During the early forties, she contributed her poetry to Sid Corman\u2019s Origin, with the likes of Charles Olson, Denise Levertov and Robert Creeley. While she is often associated with this group of poets, her content differs from theirs. Avison worked as an English literature lecturer, a secretary, a librarian, a researcher and as a social worker at a mission in downtown Toronto. Her first collection of poems was published in 1960, titled Winter Sun (University of Toronto Press), followed by The Dumbfounding (Noron, 1966). Avison\u2019s poetry was also anthologized in Eli Mandel and Jean-Guy Pilon\u2019s Poetry 62 (Ryerson, 1961). In 1963, she returned to the University of Toronto to write her thesis on Don Juan and to pursue graduate work. Avison taught and lectured English at Scarborough College and at the University of Toronto, as well as working at the Presbyterian Church Mission in Toronto. In 1970, she collaborated with bp Nichol and published The Cosmic Chef Glee & Perloo Memorial Society under the direction of Captain Poetry presents...: [an evening of concrete, courtesy of Oberon Cement Works] (Oberon Press). Avison, staying on the periphery of the poetry scene, attended and participated in several readings, and supported other writers in their pursuits. She translated poems from Hungarian, which appear in The Plough and the Pen: Writings from Hungary, 1930-1956 (London, P. Owen, 1963). Sunblue was published in 1978 by Lancelot Press, and a collected edition of Winter Sun\/The Dumbfounding: Poems 1940-1966 (McClelland & Stewart, 1982) and No time (Lancelot Press, 1989). Her Selected Poems was published in 1991 by Oxford University Press, followed by A kind of perseverance (Lancelot Press, 1994) and Not yet but still (Lancelot Press, 1997). Avison has produced a number of books, Always Now: The collected poems (Porcupine\u2019s Quill) came as a three volume series published between 2003 and 2005. Momentary dark (McClelland & Stewart, 2006), Listening: the last poems (McClelland & Stewart, 2009) and I am here and not not-there: an autobiography (Porcupine\u2019s Quill, 2009) have both recently been released. Margaret Avison died in Toronto in August of 2007.\n"

I first listened to Margaret read her poems at the poetry conference, University of British Columbia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q391028], during the summer of 1963. Her reading, together with those of the other poets on hand, are among the most memorable occasions I've had in my love affair with poems and poets. Four years later, in early January, we spent an afternoon together. Now I don't want to attribute, what I felt with a thought, on Bloor Street, to our conversation, but the warmth of it was very real. Margaret Avison was born in Guelph [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q504114], Ontario [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1904]; some early years were spent in Alberta [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1951]; she graduated from Victoria College [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3551503], the University of Toronto [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q180865], in 1940, with a BA in English Language and Literature. She has been a secretary of all sorts for various firms, individuals, and organizations, and has also been a research assistant and librarian and presently teaches English at Scarborough College, Toronto [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q172]. 1956-57 she was a Guggenheim Fellow [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Property:P6594] in poetry, and during the forties her work appeared in various Canadian magazines, and in the fifties, mainly in American ones. She has published two books of poems; The Winter Sun in 1960 won the Governor General's Award [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q283256], and in 1966, W.W. Norton [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1282208] in New York [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60] issued The Dumbfounding [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q42189162], her latest book. Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure in introducing to you Margaret Avison.\n \nUnknown\n00:02:59\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed]. \n \nMargaret Avison\n00:02:59\nI don't know about the reading but I do know about the pleasure of meeting Roy [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3445789] again here, and being introduced by him. If this were Monday, or up to a week from tonight, I would be able to join the Angry Art Week. I don't know if anybody else has received these letters, but in New York City initially they're trying this and anybody who gets a letter from them is asked to dedicate any reading or event to what they're trying to do. You can still send them money, too, I'll give you the address if you want it later. What they're going to do is play harps in railroad stations and have...lets see, Bach [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1339] cantatas in railroad stations, play-ins in various museums and the lobbies of concert halls, recital halls, business buildings--I like that one--dramatic presentations in laundromats and supermarkets, [audience laughter], a paint-in, and fences and billboards throughout Manhattan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q11299] with their work showing and so on. This is a series. \"What we're trying to do is through art to reach the American people as human beings.\" So...[audience laughter]. If this were Monday I'd dedicate the reading [audience laughter and applause]...This is all very orderly, although it doesn't look it, and it starts with other people's poems of various kinds. A little section of C. Bukowski [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q76409], somebody said that's Charles, an American poet. It's a great long thing that was in a mimeograph magazine, and the description is of a woman with a bicycle and a baby carriage, high-heeled shoes, white socks, and all her belongings, on a hot day in the middle of a road in a city. \n \nMargaret Avison\n00:05:28\nReads unnamed poem by Charles Bukowski.\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:06:30.\nThat's sad, so on the same page I copied one of Al Fowler's, which was in a magazine called Lines, which is the all-time happiest little poem, and I don't know why. I'm going to stop where the lines stop, not where the sense stops, so you can see the shape of it.  There's no capital letters. There's no title.\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:07:01\nReads \u201cAre you a root or a tendermint\u201d by Al Fowler [published in Lines 6].\n\nAudience \n00:07:20\nLaughter.\n\nMargaret Avison\n00:07:30\nThis is one by Gerry Gilbert [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5552756], called \"Zoo\".\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:07:39\nReads \"Zoo\" by Gerry Gilbert.\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:08:00\nI may bring in some more of other people's, but this is just a little, it's a friend of mine in Toronto who's made it to grade seven this year. He calls it \"The Delinquent\", and he has, in this copy he has said that it's his copyright so if you betray the fact that I read some of it, I'll be in trouble with him.\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:08:33\nReads \"The Delinquent\" by an unnamed author [audience laughter throughout].\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:10:20\nIt goes on, a bit, I want to go back to where it gets sad, though. I love \"She twisted her pinkies behind her but all the knots held more\".\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:10:30\nResumes reading \"The Delinquent\" [audience laughter throughout].\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:11:33\nThere's an awful line in the next verse. [Audience laughter].\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:11:41\nResumes reading \"The Delinquent\" [audience laughter throughout].\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:12:43\nIt ends up with knotting a burning matchstick into her old man's hair. [Audience laughter]. I think as he goes on he'll be somebody. If I'm not reading mine I'll warn of you. Some of these...the first one is a Toronto poem with footnotes, saying that TTC [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q17978] means Toronto Transit Commission, and the Ditch is an open cut on the Yonge subway between Bloor and Rosedale. \n \nMargaret Avison\n00:13:38\nReads unnamed poem.\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:14:37\nThe second subway poem...a little child, it's called \"Subway Station Why Not.\"\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:14:53\nReads \"Subway Station Why Not\".\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:15:56\nThis next one is St. Clair Avenue, where I live on the car tracks. It's called \"Insomniac Report\".\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:16:11\nReads \"Insomniac Report\".\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:17:07\nFeels as if I should be doing something different, but I don't know what. I did a poem to people writing examinations I'm hunting for, but I think I've forgotten it. There's three about this odd experience of teaching and students. This one was written before I had had the experience, but was looking forward to it. And it had the title \"Is That You\/Me Standing on My\/Your Feet?\" And it's very full of fine theory and idealism.\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:18:18\nReads \"Is That You\/Me Standing on My\/Your Feet?\".\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:19:21\nAnd I've got two other incomplete ones that should be read with that. I'll just read two stanzas of the first one, it's got one four-line stanza for the students...\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:19:36\nReads unnamed poem.\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:20:36\nThe teacher's answer hasn't got written yet. Here's another bit, two stanzas, the student and the teacher, that isn't finished. The student is talking although it doesn't sound like it. \n \nMargaret Avison\n00:21:01\nReads unnamed poem.\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:21:51\nThere's a daybreak bus I have to catch and this one is called \"October 21, '66, at a bus stop on the way\".\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:22:03\nReads \"October 21, '66, at a bus stop on the way\".\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:23:07\nI had planned to get all this organized on the plane, but I was in the middle of the three seats and I kept getting the briefcase out and everything would fall to the floor, and this one would dive for it, or this one, and I finally gave up, so it's upside down. This is dedicated to Jacques Ellul [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q322922], The Technological Society [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1607727], a book he wrote that's a little mad but very stirring.\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:23:56\nReads [\u201cMaking Senses\u201d, published later in No Time]. \n \nMargaret Avison\n00:26:39\nThere's one here that is just the equivalent to sketching, I guess. I know a poet in Chicago [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1297] who used to go and sit around in the Art Institute [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q239303], when it was a fairly quiet room, and stare all morning, and if any words occurred to him, he dashed them down. And sometime he worked up his sketches and sometime he didn't, which is a technique that's lots of fun to practice, and occasionally something grows out of it. In this case I don't think I'll ever do anything but it'll show you the kind of thing that I mean, if, as I assume, most of you are writers.\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:27:38\nReads unnamed poem. \n \nMargaret Avison\n00:28:25\nNow a poem with syntax and stuff called \"The Seven Birds\". A corner of Bathurst and College Street in Toronto which is the kind of buildings that have been there since the first world war, where there's often stores on the street level and an apartment or two above. \n \nMargaret Avison\n00:29:01\nReads \"The Seven Birds\" [published later in sunblue].\n\nMargaret Avison\n00:30:15\nI think I should read a long, fierce poem. This is not by me except translated. It's the poem of Gyula Illyes [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q381107], called \"Of Tyranny, In One Breath\". Ilona Duczynska [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q967353] did a literal translation for me and then read it to me for sound and we worked through it that way.  Apparently the poem started, or happened, in 1956 in Budapest [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1781]. Illyes had written it some years before but hadn't been angry enough at the time to risk what it was to bring it out. But he grew angry enough and somebody said the one thing that nobody censors is the magazine which tells you what lectures are going on where and what movies are running where and is just a news sheet, and the middle spread was for advertising, so they printed this in the middle sheet and it was, they tried to stop it as soon as the authorities found it but by then they were storming the radio station or however it started. I can't do it in one breath because it goes on for several pages. In the first part of it, \"it,\" meaning \"tyranny\" is small \"i\" and towards the end it's a capital \"I.\"\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:32:27\nReads English translation of \"Of Tyranny, In One Breath\" by Gyula Illyes [published later in Always Now, Vol. 1].\n\nMargaret Avison\n00:39:26\nSo, after the revolution he was much too well-known to disappear but they said he was insane and he was in an asylum for a while, but he wrote a lot of lovely things there, so I don't think he was, and he's not there now. It's much better, I think. A group of silly things it's embarrassing to read but I will, called \"Bestialities\".\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:40:19\nReads \"Bestialities\", parts 1-5 [from The Dumbfounding; audience laughter throughout].\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:41:14\nThe last one I think is just beautiful, but nobody gets it unless I explain, so I'll explain, it's like you take a piece of 8 by 11 typing paper...\n \nAudience Member 1\n00:41:26\nDon't explain, just say it.\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:41:28\nAlright, you can tell me then, eh? \n \nMargaret Avison\n00:41:33\nReads \"Bestialities\", part 6 [from The Dumbfounding].\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:41:40\nNow, come on...[Audience laughter]. Hmm? Does anybody want the explanation? Well I've read it. It's just a crumpled-up letter, you know, you get it and you read it and you cry and you crumble it up and you throw it down and the mite goes up...Now I'll read it again.\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:42:17\nReads \"Bestialities\", part 6 [from The Dumbfounding].\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:42:35\n\u201cThe Absorbed\". This is one of the very cold days, I guess about ten below, enough. It's inside the pane of glass separating inside from outside comes into it, a certain kind of sky that goes with that which is like glass again. \n \nMargaret Avison\n00:43:09\nReads \"The Absorbed\" [from The Dumbfounding].\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:45:50\nReads [\"Thaw\" from Winter Sun].\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:47:37\nI would like to read two other weather ones and then I'll give you a break. This is \u201cTwo Mayday Selves\u201d.\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:47:54\nReads \"Two Mayday Selves\" [from The Dumbfounding].\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:49:42\nAnd the last one is late spring, early summer. Jet-plane and terminuses, called \"Black-White Under Green, May 18th 1965\u201d.\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:50:06\nReads \"Black-White Under Green, May 18th 1965\u201d [published as \u201cMay 18 1965\u201d in The Dumbfounding].\n\nUnknown\n00:52:53\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n\nMargaret Avison\n00:52:54\nI've been asked to read \"The Valiant Vacationist\". It was written so many years ago...I think I would be quite right in saying thirty years ago, and probably a little more. And I couldn't write this well now but in a way when you're very young you've got the whole world in one lump without any lump, and you only get bits later on. \n \nMargaret Avison\n00:53:34\nReads \"The Valiant Vacationist\" [published later in Always Now: Vol. 1].\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:56:54\nThen the one \"To Professor X, Year Y\".\n \nMargaret Avison\n00:57:03\nReads \"To Professor X, Year Y\" [from Winter Sun].\n\nMargaret Avison\n00:59:57\nI'd like to read one introductory poem to the long one, \"The Earth that Falls Away\", and that one, and two short ones, if you'll bear with me that long. This is called \"The Absolute, the Day\".\n \nMargaret Avison\n01:00:22\nReads \"The Absolute, the Day\" [published later as \u201cAbsolute\u201d in sunblue and in Always Now Vol. 2].\n\nMargaret Avison\n01:01:39\nThis one is \"The Earth that Falls Away\". There's an epigraph from Beddoes\u2019 [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2165597] Death's Jest-Book [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q42188673]: \"Can a man die? Aye, as the sun doth set, it is the earth that falls away from light\". There are a number of human situations, some into the past, through the present generation, the rest various city people, myself, and the stories come interleaving so that as I name a new section it'll be a new group of people, and by request I'm going to  stop at the line-ends here. \n \nMargaret Avison\n01:02:32\nReads \"The Earth that Falls Away\" [from The Dumbfounding].\n \nMargaret Avison\n01:15:52\nReads [\"He Couldn\u2019t Be Safe (Isaiah 53:5)\u201d, published later in sunblue].\n \nMargaret Avison\n01:16:54\nThere's one more and I'll stop with this one. \n \nMargaret Avison\n01:17:00\nReads [section from \u201cThe Jo Poems\u201d, part 6. Published later in No Time. Subtitled \u201cHaving\u201d in Always Now: Vol. 2].\n \nEND\n01:17:54\n[Cut off abruptly].\n",

His Collected Poems was published by Scriveners in 1962 under the title For Love. He has also published short stories and they're brought out by Scriveners after first being published, privately I believe, under the title of The Gold Diggers. His most recent book, also brought out by Scriveners, is called Words. Mr. Creeley has a style that is unique and inimitable. There are many, both in this country [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16?wprov=srpw1_0] and in United States of America [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30?wprov=srpw1_0] that are trying to capture the delicate, tenuous quality of his work, and not quite successfully. For his is an art of pauses, of hesitations. He affirms by diffidence, and he destroys our pretensions with a whisper. He uses silence as a modern composer of music [unintelligible], or the way a contemporary painter uses space. He bounces words off against the wall of [unintelligible]. If you listen carefully, you'll hear reverberations and the subtlest of echoes. Mr. Creeley is one of the most honest poets writing today. And a very brave man, who knows the price that has to be paid for a good poem certified to endure. He has written a little song, sing days of happiness, make a pardonable wonder of one's blunders. The man who wrote those words knows all that needs to be known about the perilous vocation of the poet. One critic has said his poems are miniatures, but then hastened to add that they are not miniatures, sorry-One critic has said-this is not from memory-One critic has said that his poems are miniatures, but there's nothing miniature about the power that they release. I have said somewhere that he has written skinny poems, that miraculously grow in length and breath, one's air absorbed into one's consciousness. Slender firecrackers that explode with the power of a bomb. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Robert Creeley.\n\nAudience\n00:03:42\nApplause.\n\nRobert Creeley\n00:03:52\nSee now, it's extremely generous, Irving [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1673289], all that. No, because we have had a very long association. I think I'd like to say my piece too, apropos that fact that I think that the kind of community that say either Irving or myself in this way were involved with was what kinds of, no really, how could you find the world?  I mean, I, for example first read his poems in the collection called Cerberus with Louis Dudek [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3261787] and Raymond Souster [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q304129] and then I was very interested in the magazine that they had going called Contact, I was looking for connections I suppose, the man, in no hips sense, but we were, I was extraordinar--I wanted to know where the world was, and Irving seemed to be very much, very much part of any world I certainly could respect. And so, what he generously and definitely himself ignores was that he was that he was a very decisive contributing editor for the Black Mountain Review, and it was really, a very decisive friend all those fifteen years he imagines. Let me read now. Let me start from back then, \"A Song\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:05:47\nReads \"A Song\" [from For Love].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:06:37\nThis is apropos. \"The Conspiracy\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:06:43\nReads \"The Conspiracy\" [from For Love].\n \nAudience\n00:07:11\nLaughter.\n\nRobert Creeley\n00:07:12\nThat was no joke. \"Chanson\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:07:26\nReads \"Chanson\" [from For Love].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:08:00\n\"The Operation\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:08:05\nReads \"The Operation\" [from For Love].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:08:35\n\"The Death of Venus\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:08:41\nReads \"The Death of Venus\" [from For Love].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:09:17\nI was thinking Paul Blackburn [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7149388] happily has been here, so this is a poem, again of the same, the same situation that we were very active in the exchange of, I mean, again I want to emphasize  the sense that we were looking around to see what kinds of possibility that we could find in the world and I suppose if we shared anything, I was thinking of Irving's lovely stories and letters about the problems of visiting literary parties [laughs] and partly being forbidden because he made such awkward problems for guests and hosts, etc. So that Paul Blackburn at this point was translating from Provencal poetry, he'd been at the University of Wisconsin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q838330] and had had a very active and useful relation with the woman there, I think it was, teaching Provencal, so that he'd also been very involved with Pound [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q163366?wprov=srpw1_0], with Pound's senses of activity in verse and had therefore become particularly interested in Provencal and had begun to translate, and through the same agency that we had in Mallorca [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q8828], my wife and I then, the so called Divers Press that had published Irving's book, we published a collection of Paul's Provencal translations called Proensa. So the title, is actually Paul's title, I can't now remember what- I don't think he ever published the poem it was the title for, but I was struck by it, and you know, you take things, obviously from friends, it was that you were stealing, but that it was always a common situation. It's a form of adaptation, and I think a young friend now at Buffalo [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q681025] were presently working was telling me that I am in the courtly tradition which is confusing to me, but I can see what he means simply that did pick up a lot through Paul Blackburn and writers in this way using a vocabulary or sense of possibility involved with that kind of writing. So this poem, for example, would be, would be actually a, would be a poem not written by Paul Blackburn, but a poem much informed by his way of perceiving. \"A Form of Adaptation\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:11:46\nReads \"A Form of Adaptation\" [from For Love].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:12:40\n\u201cThe Whip\u201d.\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:12:43\nReads \"The Whip\" [from For Love].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:13:29\n\"Please\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:13:36\nReads \"Please\" [from For Love].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:14:36\n\"The Three Ladies\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:14:39\nReads \"The Three Ladies\" [from For Love].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:16:04\n[Unintelligible] \"New Year\u2019s\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:16:17\nReads \"New Year\u2019s\" [from For Love].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:17:34\n\"Entre Nous\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:17:40\nReads \"Entre Nous\" [from For Love].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:18:08\n\"The Place\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:18:11\nReads \"The Place\" [from For Love].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:19:20\n\"The Hill\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:19:32\nReads \"The Hill\" [from For Love].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:20:21\n\"The Awakening\" for Charles Olson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q922978].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:20:25\nReads \"The Awakening\" [from For Love].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:22:04\n\"The Rain\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:22:12\nReads \"The Rain\" [from For Love]. \n \nRobert Creeley\n00:23:12\n\"Kore\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:23:20\nReads \"Kore\" [from For Love].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:24:09\nI thought I'd read a few more of these in this particular collection.

There's one... called, \"Anger\". This interpolates, so to speak of. I've been traveling in an extraordinary company of people the last, or the week previous and then, we'll see them again at the same activity tomorrow night in New York [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60?wprov=srpw1_0]. We were billed as quote contemporary voices in the arts, unquote, but apart from that the, we were visiting various colleges and universities in the Upstate New York area from say Albany State [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4709390] to Rensselaer Polytechnic [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q49211] to Potsdam [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7603628], and then places St Lawrence [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1411093] or Union College [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1567748] and we were trying, in effect, to- we had the problem of we were billed as a panel, seven men, sitting down to discuss- John Cage [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q180727] is one of the participants, and he said, 'well', of course if we sit down, we say, 'well where do you think art is going?' and then you have to figure out where do you think art's come from? [laughter] And at that point you just might as well come home because it's going to be a long, long conversation. So we decided that we would, instead of having the formal sense of panel, that we would simply create, improvise, or go about in effect at our own activity, except that we wouldn't isolate ourselves in that but would simply try to improvise, as we were seven people, a poem that could permit each one of us to be active, all together so that we at no point had much- we had no decision as to what the others would be doing, so that the whole activity occurred as the complex, and I was- I mean, I had never had any experience of this kind previously at all, John Cage had made, oh very large decisions indeed about this kind of possibility in music, simply that he wanted all possibility of sound to be admitted into the context that music proposes. He also had very decisive relation to what are called loosely 'happenings', and both he and Merce Cunningham [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q318364], another participant, had in that with some previous experience, but the point is that they weren't- neither was trying to create a system from previous experience, but again was trying to think of how this activity of seven people could be evident in ways that simply didn't create a three-ring circus but was actually a participation so, I was intrigued, I was extraordinarily intrigued as to how words, as poetry and whatnot could enter into this circumstance, and because I literally was in it, I have in a sense no quote objective unquote experience at all, but it was extraordinary to me to hear how things are heard in a multiple, in a multiple event, rather than the kind of singularity that this occasion proposes. So I still have that on my mind in a way, and I may, I really do feel that say, all the arts, I mean if one does want some kind of statement about them, that all the arts are moving into a situation where the agency is becoming less and less singular, I don't mean necessarily that in some seminal sense, that everyone's quote an artist, I mean I don't know what an artist is, in one way at all, but I think that the participation is becoming much more a situation of process and activity, and that it is becoming less and less evident as one singular isolation of person, and I realize in my own writing how much the previous condition had been my, my occasion. So, I may be reading these poems for the last time in that sense. I'm certainly prepared to do so, I'm not at all interested in continuing an activity that maybe, you know, maybe have much more experience or much more range of possibility than say contemporary habits about it seem to imply. But anyhow, that was interesting to me to have that experience and also interesting of course is what it had as an impact on educational process. Immediately this activity finished and I've never been in such a- I mean I've been, you know, like they say in [unintelligible] auditorium in the summer, I certainly have seen light shows and other [unintelligible] happenings, a few years ago, it was Roy Kiyooka [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3445789], knows, having been there also, there was an extraordinary happening like they say put on by the Tate Music Center from San Francisco [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q62]  [unintelligible] being the painter doing the so called decor, doing the set, the set that was used, creating the visual. But this other thing was something quite distinct, simply that each person was so active in ways that he couldn't anticipate and we had with us also Billy Kluver [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4912866], who can be most easily identified as the man who, is literally is an Engineer at Bell Labs [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q217365] in New Jersey [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1408?wprov=srpw1_0] who engineered the 9 Evenings [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4646407] of the Armory [Hall (?)] in company with Rauschenberg [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q164358], [Vergan (?)] and Cage [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q180727] and others, a situation that brought technology into close apropos with the arts, and led to the practical effects of this activity are very evident, it led to ten patented inventions, all of which have much more extensive use, let's say than that occasion of those particular evenings. That was [unintelligible] you know, many, many poets [unintelligible] of this kind, that is, it turns out that when the arts are permitted this situation, that, I think we were talking to Irving earlier this evening, I think we both fear a situation, or have some kind of, feeling of personal awkwardness about a situation that is turning to the arts as if the arts had a necessary message or condition of life to stake for people to have use of, I mean, again, in these evenings we were round in these colleges, I mean the students or the people present, again and again said that \"what were you trying to tell us?\" And the point was that we weren't trying to tell them anything. We were in fact, we thought, that the activity was something which each person could have experienced, it would be like going to the beach and saying what do you think the water is trying to tell us? [audience laughter.] And you stand there, you're swimming [unintelligible] for two hours enjoying yourself thoroughly and then you come out and say to your friend, but what did it all mean? You know, we assumed that the people there would have some - would have some decision of their own, you know, did you think it was too cold, or too hot, or did you enjoy it, or you know, that's the kind of question no one can answer for you. In any case, I do feel the arts has, as Irving feels also, are being turned to, as some possibility of decision in contemporary society and don't think they can offer that ever, I don't- I think the very value of the arts is that they have no conclusion of this kind to propose, that what they do give is something I think perhaps Pound puts as ably as anyone when he says that \"art is the antenna of the race\". It's a very large statement obviously, and I think what he proposes in it is perhaps even can be put more simply in that the arts tend to experience the condition of the society that is, in a sense, and that way I have use of the condition of the society, perhaps more immediately than any other definition or activity in the society, I mean they tend to respond to the present condition perhaps more decisively than any other segment, I mean everyone else tends, not- I don't mean this in any put down sense of their attitudes in this society but I mean, that as the war goes on because it's an historical precedent and so on and so forth, I mean people continued to act as though what they were doing is still what they are doing, what they are doing is still what they were doing and they literally tend to continue in those habits of attitude or activity until something simply makes them impossible, but the arts tend to have experience I think of present condition, that they have no other viable occasion, they tend to propose what the immediate experience of say any life situation simply is, but they have no instruction therefore offer except that is possible, so that as I say, if poetry, as we've now experienced it is about to yield to another situation that is if books or printed medium of this order are to be changed, in societal experience, great, I mean I don't see why I want you to have to carry around all these pieces of paper, there must be, I'm sure that there's a simple way to communicate this kind of content but I do want to make the insistence that these poems or what I'm doing here has- I mean, I'm enjoying this, I'd probably do this even if you weren't here. [audience laughter], obviously did do it, you know. Now this is something else again, I had no messages, if the media is the message, this is perhaps the most absolute demonstration you'll probably get. \"Anger\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:54:01\nReads \"Anger\" [from Words].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:59:25\nI'd like if people are feeling reasonably restless, I'd like to read one or two more poems and then one more story to make a selection frankly [unintelligible]  I think I'll see what would be useful. A couple of shorter poems for the end. One called \"A Tally\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n01:00:01\nReads \"A Tally\" [from Words].\n \nRobert Creeley\n01:01:41\n\"Enough\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n01:01:45\nReads \"Enough\" [from Words].\n \nRobert Creeley\n01:06:00\nOne last poem I want to read now, [unintelligible] \"The Hole\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n01:06:07\nReads \"The Hole\" [from Words].\n \nRobert Creeley\n01:07:53\nRead a story that's in effect going back some time to the time of the writing of the Island, a novel. And I hadn't written any prose for some time, not since the middle 50's and I had a [joke (?)], myself and my wife and our four kids were all down in Guatemala [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q774]where I was tutoring children on a coffee plantation, and having that kind of isolation and time that seemed to, you know, have the possibility to try some prose. I like prose simply that it has--it's continuous, it permits a kind of variety of activity in ways that sometimes poetry from my own experience, at least in the way I'm given to write it, doesn't altogether- I mean, the emotional demand, let's say in a poem is in my own experience has known it, is of such order that alternatives in a curious way aren't possible, you simply say what you're thus brought to say as best you can. In prose, the emotional so called situation tends to be more various, it goes up, down, it ebbs, flows, re-forms, changes its mind, and so on and so forth, so I--not in recent years, I think the last prose I wrote was this novel, called the Island and I've not really written any since, that's about--when I was in Vancouver [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q24639]teaching I finished that novel, and that was the last prose I think I've written and hopefully won't--I would like to go back to prose for a time. I'd like to have it open, I mean, again, this experience of being with these particular people, whenever habits become, oh let's say whenever you expect everything to be as you have experienced, it's time to look out or do something else because it means that you're assuming of the reality of your life has become too much of a pattern of a habit. Anyhow, this is a story called \"The Book\". I sort of like this story.\n \nRobert Creeley\n01:10:22\nReads \"The Book\".\n\nRobert Creeley\n01:21:15\nThank you very much for your...\n\nAudience \n01:21:16\nApplause.\n\nIntroducer\n01:21:39\nI think I speak for everyone in thanking Robert Creeley for being able to come down and make the scene tonight. There are a couple of announcements that I want to make, the first one I can't remember so I'll have to [unintelligible], [Audrey Brunet (?)], that I do remember invites everyone to come to hear \"Prayers on the Periphery\", an original reading, this coming Monday, March the 6th at 8:30 pm in the little gallery on the mezzanine. Our next reading is a week from now, next Friday, March the 3rd, and Victor Coleman [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q23882910] and George Bowering [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1239280] from Buffalo [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q40435]  and Toronto [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q172] will be coming. Thank you.\n\nAudience\n01:22:32\nApplause.\n\nUnknown\n01:22:45\n[Cut or edit made in tape].\n\nRobert Creeley \n01:22:48\nReads \u201cThe Book\u201d [repeated from 00:27:43].\n\nEND\n01:23:12\n"

                "notes": "American poet and essayist Robert Creeley was born in 1926 in Arlington, Massachusetts. His early life was marred by tragedy, as he lost his left eye in an accident and suffered the death of his father when he was four years old. Creeley then grew up on a farm, and felt repressed by his traditional Puritanical New England upbringing. After a year of Harvard University, Creeley joined the US Field Service in India and Burma. Returning again to Harvard, he married his first wife Ann MacKinnon, with whom he had three children, only to leave Harvard in his final semester. From 1948 to 1950, Creeley and his family moved to several locations including Provincetown, New Hampshire; Provenance, France; and Mallorca, Spain. Once in Mallorca, he set up The Divers Press with poet Denise Levertov. Creeley thus began correspondence with Charles Olson, and Olson offered Creeley a teaching position at the Black Mountain College in North Carolina, as well as a Bachelor\u2019s degree in 1954. During his short time at Black Mountain, Creely edited Black Mountain Review, a journal known for its experimental writing. As well as many publications in poetry magazines, he published his first collection of short stories in The Gold Diggers in 1954 (Divers Press). After his marriage dissolved, Creeley headed West to San Francisco, meeting with Allen Ginsberg, Gary Snyder, and Kenneth Rexroth, as well as other Beat poets during the San Francisco Poetry Renaissance. Creeley then moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, completed his M.A., and then took a position as professor of English. There, he met and married Bobbie Louise Hall, with whom he had two daughters and for whom he wrote most of his love poetry. His first major collection of poetry was For Love: Poems 1950-1960, published in 1962 (Scribner Press). Creeley subsequently published his novel, The Island (Scribner Press, 1963), and other poetry collections including Words (Scribner), The Charm: Early and Uncollected Poems (Perishable Press, 1967), and Pieces (Scribner, 1969). His essays and prose publications include A Quick Graph: Collected Notes and Essays (Four Seasons Foundation, 1970), A Sense of Measure (Calder and Boyars, 1973), and Was That a Real Poem and Other Essays (Four Seasons Foundation, 1979). His marriage with Bobbie ended in the late 70\u2019s, and he married his third wife, Penelope Highton.  Creeley continued to publish his poetry in collections such as Later (New Directions, 1979), Mirrors (New Directions, 1983), Windows (New Directions, 1990), Echoes (New Directions, 1994), Life and Death (New Directions, 1998), and If I Were Writing This (New Directions, 2003). He has won a number of awards and honors, including the New York State Poet Laureate from 1989-91. He was elected a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets in 1999, received the Lannan Lifetime Achievement Award, the Bollingen Prize, the Shelley Memorial Award, a Rockefeller Grant and two Guggenheim Fellowships. Robert Creeley died in 2005, but his poetry has been published posthumously in On Earth: Last Poems and an Essay (University of California Press, 2009), The Collected Poems of Robert Creeley, 1975-2005 (University of California Press, 2006) and Robert Creeley: Selected Poems, 1945-2005 (University of California Press, 2008)."

                "contents": "Irving Layton\n00:00:15\nMr. Creeley [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q918620] has published too many books for me to list for you this evening, but some titles are deserving of notice. His Collected Poems was published by Scriveners in 1962 under the title For Love. He has also published short stories and they're brought out by Scriveners after first being published, privately I believe, under the title of The Gold Diggers. His most recent book, also brought out by Scriveners, is called Words. Mr. Creeley has a style that is unique and inimitable. There are many, both in this country [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16?wprov=srpw1_0] and in United States of America [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30?wprov=srpw1_0] that are trying to capture the delicate, tenuous quality of his work, and not quite successfully. For his is an art of pauses, of hesitations. He affirms by diffidence, and he destroys our pretensions with a whisper. He uses silence as a modern composer of music [unintelligible], or the way a contemporary painter uses space. He bounces words off against the wall of [unintelligible]. If you listen carefully, you'll hear reverberations and the subtlest of echoes. Mr. Creeley is one of the most honest poets writing today. And a very brave man, who knows the price that has to be paid for a good poem certified to endure. He has written a little song, sing days of happiness, make a pardonable wonder of one's blunders. The man who wrote those words knows all that needs to be known about the perilous vocation of the poet. One critic has said his poems are miniatures, but then hastened to add that they are not miniatures, sorry-One critic has said-this is not from memory-One critic has said that his poems are miniatures, but there's nothing miniature about the power that they release. I have said somewhere that he has written skinny poems, that miraculously grow in length and breath, one's air absorbed into one's consciousness. Slender firecrackers that explode with the power of a bomb. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Robert Creeley.\n\nAudience\n00:03:42\nApplause.\n\nRobert Creeley\n00:03:52\nSee now, it's extremely generous, Irving [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1673289], all that. No, because we have had a very long association. I think I'd like to say my piece too, apropos that fact that I think that the kind of community that say either Irving or myself in this way were involved with was what kinds of, no really, how could you find the world?  I mean, I, for example first read his poems in the collection called Cerberus with Louis Dudek [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3261787] and Raymond Souster [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q304129] and then I was very interested in the magazine that they had going called Contact, I was looking for connections I suppose, the man, in no hips sense, but we were, I was extraordinar--I wanted to know where the world was, and Irving seemed to be very much, very much part of any world I certainly could respect. And so, what he generously and definitely himself ignores was that he was that he was a very decisive contributing editor for the Black Mountain Review, and it was really, a very decisive friend all those fifteen years he imagines. Let me read now. Let me start from back then, \"A Song\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:05:47\nReads \"A Song\" [from For Love].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:06:37\nThis is apropos. \"The Conspiracy\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:06:43\nReads \"The Conspiracy\" [from For Love].\n \nAudience\n00:07:11\nLaughter.\n\nRobert Creeley\n00:07:12\nThat was no joke. \"Chanson\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:07:26\nReads \"Chanson\" [from For Love].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:08:00\n\"The Operation\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:08:05\nReads \"The Operation\" [from For Love].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:08:35\n\"The Death of Venus\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:08:41\nReads \"The Death of Venus\" [from For Love].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:09:17\nI was thinking Paul Blackburn [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7149388] happily has been here, so this is a poem, again of the same, the same situation that we were very active in the exchange of, I mean, again I want to emphasize  the sense that we were looking around to see what kinds of possibility that we could find in the world and I suppose if we shared anything, I was thinking of Irving's lovely stories and letters about the problems of visiting literary parties [laughs] and partly being forbidden because he made such awkward problems for guests and hosts, etc. So that Paul Blackburn at this point was translating from Provencal poetry, he'd been at the University of Wisconsin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q838330] and had had a very active and useful relation with the woman there, I think it was, teaching Provencal, so that he'd also been very involved with Pound [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q163366?wprov=srpw1_0], with Pound's senses of activity in verse and had therefore become particularly interested in Provencal and had begun to translate, and through the same agency that we had in Mallorca [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q8828], my wife and I then, the so called Divers Press that had published Irving's book, we published a collection of Paul's Provencal translations called Proensa. So the title, is actually Paul's title, I can't now remember what- I don't think he ever published the poem it was the title for, but I was struck by it, and you know, you take things, obviously from friends, it was that you were stealing, but that it was always a common situation. It's a form of adaptation, and I think a young friend now at Buffalo [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q681025] were presently working was telling me that I am in the courtly tradition which is confusing to me, but I can see what he means simply that did pick up a lot through Paul Blackburn and writers in this way using a vocabulary or sense of possibility involved with that kind of writing. So this poem, for example, would be, would be actually a, would be a poem not written by Paul Blackburn, but a poem much informed by his way of perceiving. \"A Form of Adaptation\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:11:46\nReads \"A Form of Adaptation\" [from For Love].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:12:40\n\u201cThe Whip\u201d.\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:12:43\nReads \"The Whip\" [from For Love].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:13:29\n\"Please\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:13:36\nReads \"Please\" [from For Love].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:14:36\n\"The Three Ladies\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:14:39\nReads \"The Three Ladies\" [from For Love].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:16:04\n[Unintelligible] \"New Year\u2019s\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:16:17\nReads \"New Year\u2019s\" [from For Love].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:17:34\n\"Entre Nous\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:17:40\nReads \"Entre Nous\" [from For Love].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:18:08\n\"The Place\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:18:11\nReads \"The Place\" [from For Love].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:19:20\n\"The Hill\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:19:32\nReads \"The Hill\" [from For Love].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:20:21\n\"The Awakening\" for Charles Olson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q922978].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:20:25\nReads \"The Awakening\" [from For Love].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:22:04\n\"The Rain\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:22:12\nReads \"The Rain\" [from For Love]. \n \nRobert Creeley\n00:23:12\n\"Kore\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:23:20\nReads \"Kore\" [from For Love].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:24:09\nI thought I'd read a few more of these in this particular collection.

There's one... called, \"Anger\". This interpolates, so to speak of. I've been traveling in an extraordinary company of people the last, or the week previous and then, we'll see them again at the same activity tomorrow night in New York [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60?wprov=srpw1_0]. We were billed as quote contemporary voices in the arts, unquote, but apart from that the, we were visiting various colleges and universities in the Upstate New York area from say Albany State [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4709390] to Rensselaer Polytechnic [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q49211] to Potsdam [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7603628], and then places St Lawrence [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1411093] or Union College [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1567748] and we were trying, in effect, to- we had the problem of we were billed as a panel, seven men, sitting down to discuss- John Cage [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q180727] is one of the participants, and he said, 'well', of course if we sit down, we say, 'well where do you think art is going?' and then you have to figure out where do you think art's come from? [laughter] And at that point you just might as well come home because it's going to be a long, long conversation. So we decided that we would, instead of having the formal sense of panel, that we would simply create, improvise, or go about in effect at our own activity, except that we wouldn't isolate ourselves in that but would simply try to improvise, as we were seven people, a poem that could permit each one of us to be active, all together so that we at no point had much- we had no decision as to what the others would be doing, so that the whole activity occurred as the complex, and I was- I mean, I had never had any experience of this kind previously at all, John Cage had made, oh very large decisions indeed about this kind of possibility in music, simply that he wanted all possibility of sound to be admitted into the context that music proposes. He also had very decisive relation to what are called loosely 'happenings', and both he and Merce Cunningham [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q318364], another participant, had in that with some previous experience, but the point is that they weren't- neither was trying to create a system from previous experience, but again was trying to think of how this activity of seven people could be evident in ways that simply didn't create a three-ring circus but was actually a participation so, I was intrigued, I was extraordinarily intrigued as to how words, as poetry and whatnot could enter into this circumstance, and because I literally was in it, I have in a sense no quote objective unquote experience at all, but it was extraordinary to me to hear how things are heard in a multiple, in a multiple event, rather than the kind of singularity that this occasion proposes. So I still have that on my mind in a way, and I may, I really do feel that say, all the arts, I mean if one does want some kind of statement about them, that all the arts are moving into a situation where the agency is becoming less and less singular, I don't mean necessarily that in some seminal sense, that everyone's quote an artist, I mean I don't know what an artist is, in one way at all, but I think that the participation is becoming much more a situation of process and activity, and that it is becoming less and less evident as one singular isolation of person, and I realize in my own writing how much the previous condition had been my, my occasion. So, I may be reading these poems for the last time in that sense. I'm certainly prepared to do so, I'm not at all interested in continuing an activity that maybe, you know, maybe have much more experience or much more range of possibility than say contemporary habits about it seem to imply. But anyhow, that was interesting to me to have that experience and also interesting of course is what it had as an impact on educational process. Immediately this activity finished and I've never been in such a- I mean I've been, you know, like they say in [unintelligible] auditorium in the summer, I certainly have seen light shows and other [unintelligible] happenings, a few years ago, it was Roy Kiyooka [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3445789], knows, having been there also, there was an extraordinary happening like they say put on by the Tate Music Center from San Francisco [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q62]  [unintelligible] being the painter doing the so called decor, doing the set, the set that was used, creating the visual. But this other thing was something quite distinct, simply that each person was so active in ways that he couldn't anticipate and we had with us also Billy Kluver [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4912866], who can be most easily identified as the man who, is literally is an Engineer at Bell Labs [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q217365] in New Jersey [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1408?wprov=srpw1_0] who engineered the 9 Evenings [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4646407] of the Armory [Hall (?)] in company with Rauschenberg [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q164358], [Vergan (?)] and Cage [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q180727] and others, a situation that brought technology into close apropos with the arts, and led to the practical effects of this activity are very evident, it led to ten patented inventions, all of which have much more extensive use, let's say than that occasion of those particular evenings. That was [unintelligible] you know, many, many poets [unintelligible] of this kind, that is, it turns out that when the arts are permitted this situation, that, I think we were talking to Irving earlier this evening, I think we both fear a situation, or have some kind of, feeling of personal awkwardness about a situation that is turning to the arts as if the arts had a necessary message or condition of life to stake for people to have use of, I mean, again, in these evenings we were round in these colleges, I mean the students or the people present, again and again said that \"what were you trying to tell us?\" And the point was that we weren't trying to tell them anything. We were in fact, we thought, that the activity was something which each person could have experienced, it would be like going to the beach and saying what do you think the water is trying to tell us? [audience laughter.] And you stand there, you're swimming [unintelligible] for two hours enjoying yourself thoroughly and then you come out and say to your friend, but what did it all mean? You know, we assumed that the people there would have some - would have some decision of their own, you know, did you think it was too cold, or too hot, or did you enjoy it, or you know, that's the kind of question no one can answer for you. In any case, I do feel the arts has, as Irving feels also, are being turned to, as some possibility of decision in contemporary society and don't think they can offer that ever, I don't- I think the very value of the arts is that they have no conclusion of this kind to propose, that what they do give is something I think perhaps Pound puts as ably as anyone when he says that \"art is the antenna of the race\". It's a very large statement obviously, and I think what he proposes in it is perhaps even can be put more simply in that the arts tend to experience the condition of the society that is, in a sense, and that way I have use of the condition of the society, perhaps more immediately than any other definition or activity in the society, I mean they tend to respond to the present condition perhaps more decisively than any other segment, I mean everyone else tends, not- I don't mean this in any put down sense of their attitudes in this society but I mean, that as the war goes on because it's an historical precedent and so on and so forth, I mean people continued to act as though what they were doing is still what they are doing, what they are doing is still what they were doing and they literally tend to continue in those habits of attitude or activity until something simply makes them impossible, but the arts tend to have experience I think of present condition, that they have no other viable occasion, they tend to propose what the immediate experience of say any life situation simply is, but they have no instruction therefore offer except that is possible, so that as I say, if poetry, as we've now experienced it is about to yield to another situation that is if books or printed medium of this order are to be changed, in societal experience, great, I mean I don't see why I want you to have to carry around all these pieces of paper, there must be, I'm sure that there's a simple way to communicate this kind of content but I do want to make the insistence that these poems or what I'm doing here has- I mean, I'm enjoying this, I'd probably do this even if you weren't here. [audience laughter], obviously did do it, you know. Now this is something else again, I had no messages, if the media is the message, this is perhaps the most absolute demonstration you'll probably get. \"Anger\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:54:01\nReads \"Anger\" [from Words].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:59:25\nI'd like if people are feeling reasonably restless, I'd like to read one or two more poems and then one more story to make a selection frankly [unintelligible]  I think I'll see what would be useful. A couple of shorter poems for the end. One called \"A Tally\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n01:00:01\nReads \"A Tally\" [from Words].\n \nRobert Creeley\n01:01:41\n\"Enough\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n01:01:45\nReads \"Enough\" [from Words].\n \nRobert Creeley\n01:06:00\nOne last poem I want to read now, [unintelligible] \"The Hole\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n01:06:07\nReads \"The Hole\" [from Words].\n \nRobert Creeley\n01:07:53\nRead a story that's in effect going back some time to the time of the writing of the Island, a novel. And I hadn't written any prose for some time, not since the middle 50's and I had a [joke (?)], myself and my wife and our four kids were all down in Guatemala [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q774]where I was tutoring children on a coffee plantation, and having that kind of isolation and time that seemed to, you know, have the possibility to try some prose. I like prose simply that it has--it's continuous, it permits a kind of variety of activity in ways that sometimes poetry from my own experience, at least in the way I'm given to write it, doesn't altogether- I mean, the emotional demand, let's say in a poem is in my own experience has known it, is of such order that alternatives in a curious way aren't possible, you simply say what you're thus brought to say as best you can. In prose, the emotional so called situation tends to be more various, it goes up, down, it ebbs, flows, re-forms, changes its mind, and so on and so forth, so I--not in recent years, I think the last prose I wrote was this novel, called the Island and I've not really written any since, that's about--when I was in Vancouver [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q24639]teaching I finished that novel, and that was the last prose I think I've written and hopefully won't--I would like to go back to prose for a time. I'd like to have it open, I mean, again, this experience of being with these particular people, whenever habits become, oh let's say whenever you expect everything to be as you have experienced, it's time to look out or do something else because it means that you're assuming of the reality of your life has become too much of a pattern of a habit. Anyhow, this is a story called \"The Book\". I sort of like this story.\n \nRobert Creeley\n01:10:22\nReads \"The Book\".\n\nRobert Creeley\n01:21:15\nThank you very much for your...\n\nAudience \n01:21:16\nApplause.\n\nIntroducer\n01:21:39\nI think I speak for everyone in thanking Robert Creeley for being able to come down and make the scene tonight. There are a couple of announcements that I want to make, the first one I can't remember so I'll have to [unintelligible], [Audrey Brunet (?)], that I do remember invites everyone to come to hear \"Prayers on the Periphery\", an original reading, this coming Monday, March the 6th at 8:30 pm in the little gallery on the mezzanine. Our next reading is a week from now, next Friday, March the 3rd, and Victor Coleman [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q23882910] and George Bowering [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1239280] from Buffalo [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q40435]  and Toronto [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q172] will be coming.

You may smoke at intermission, but please do not smoke during the readings. Our first reader tonight is Mr. Victor Coleman [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q23882910] who comes to us from Toronto [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q172]. Mr. Coleman is the publisher of Island Magazine [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q15754909], and Is Magazine which is spelled 'i' 's' and looks like 'is' but is pronounced 'I\u2019s', and he is also the publisher and editor of Island Press. He is a very active promoter of new Canadian poetry and he himself has published in several little magazines in Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16] and he has made translations from Erik Satie's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q187192] notes to the music, he has also been published in New Wave Canada, an anthology of new Canadian poets published by Contact Press, and edited by Raymond Souster [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q304129]. He is also affiliated, his press, Island Press, is affiliated with the Coach House Press [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5137585] in Toronto and through this press a book of his poems will be appearing this spring. He is our first reader and our second reader is Mr. George Bowering [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1239280], who has already published three books, the first one by Contact Press called Points On The Grid, the second one, The Silver Wire published by Quarry Press and the third one, A Man in Yellow Boots, by El Corno Emplumado which was done bilingually in Spanish and in English and which contains montages and illustrations by poet and artist Roy Kiyooka [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3445789]. Mr. Bowering is also editor of Imago Magazine, which emanated from Alberta [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1951] and which is devoted to the long poem or the longer poem, he is expecting to publish very shortly, in the spring I believe, a novel called The Mirror on the Floor. Mr. Coleman will read first, and then there will be a short intermission, and then Mr. Bowering will read to you.\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:02:49\nI like to make it a habit always at a reading to start off with something that somebody else wrote, simply to show you that my concerns lie elsewhere, then in my own self. This is something from A History of America by an American writer by the name of Bill Hutton and it's\u2014 well, I won't explain it to you.\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:03:35\nReads unnamed poem by Bill Hutton.\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:06:00\nI'll read a few short poems first, and then go into something from a sequence, a longer sequence. This is a poem dedicated to Bill Hutton, the author of that piece I just read, it's called \"Buff Hello, 6\".\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:06:33\nReads \"Buff Hello, 6\".\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:08:27\nI'm going to focus on that clock every once in a while, simply because I want to keep track of myself. If I might say, um, it's interesting that I'm reading with George Bowering and my general tenure at this time, uh, which I'm not really that self-conscious about which is interesting to me to be growing a beard at this time and that the last time that I started to grow a beard was the first time that I met George Bowering and it was about two years ago and we were sitting up in my attic which was a room and I said to him, \"How do you like my beard?\" and he says that \"It makes you look like an impotent D.H. Lawrence [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q34970]\u201d. [Audience laughter]. This is a poem called \"The Lady Vanishes\".\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:09:41\nReads \"The Lady Vanishes\".\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:11:14\nHere's a kind of poem that I can bug everybody with because it probably won't mean anything to you at all, but simply because it really is my occasion but rather than hide it away, um, I think that the sound of it is enough to carry to you, some measure of the poetry that I got from the occasion that I speak of. It's called \"For Basil Bunting\".\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:11:48\nReads \"For Basil Bunting\".\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:12:34\nI don't know whether any of you are familiar with a Japanese-English dictionary called Kenkyusha [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6389422], if not, all I can tell you is that it's a Japanese-English dictionary and that it has a strange quality to be able to predict the future, by chance operations in that it's very fat and you open it and you're like the guy with the funny hat at the track who really shouldn't be there because he can only guess and he just opens the racing form and sticks his finger on the horse and he bets on the horse and he usually loses. Kenkyusha is a little better than that because you're not trying to win anything, you're looking for some kind of instruction and the time I wrote these poems I was rather desperate for some kind of instruction, and uh, it's just a matter of opening the book, pointing and getting the epigraph for each poem from the Japanese-English dictionary. I'll just read a couple. \"Day Seven\", oh there are given days, that are sort of daily devotions.\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:14:09\nReads \"Day Seven\".\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:14:33\nReads \"Day Eight\".\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:15:19\nReads \"Day Ten\".\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:16:18\nMany of these relate to certain experiences with LSD also.\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:16:29\nReads \"Day Thirteen\".\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:16:49\nThe reason that the definitions, the English definitions in this section are so interesting and not like the ones we are accustomed to is because the characters that they represent go through their own changes and it's almost an ideogrammatic dictionary rather than a dictionary of definitions.\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:17:13\nResumes reading \u201cDay Thirteen\u201d.\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:20:17\nI need to get one of those spider clocks, can't read in this light.\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:20:39\nReads \"Day Twenty-One\" .\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:22:36\nReads \"Day Twenty-Two\".\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:24:56\nReads \"Day Twenty-Four\".\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:28:22\nThese next poems are the poems that are closest to me now. It's another long sequence called \"Separations\" and I don't think I need to give you any background on it. I'll not read the whole thing because it's quite long.\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:28:56\nReads \"Separations\u201d [parts 4-8, 10-12, and 14].\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:37:00\nThank you.\n \nEND\n00:37:17\n"

By the end of 1964, he had met poet Raymond Souster and founded Island Magazine and Island Press, drawing the avant-garde poetry centre from the West Coast to Toronto. Mr. Coleman was a publishing assistant for the Oxford University Press in Toronto from 1966 to 1967, after which he served for almost ten years as the editor for Coach House Press. Coleman was influential in the creations of Is, Image Nation, The Goose & Duck and Open Letter magazines and journals. He published his own poetry in From Erik Satie\u2019s Notes to the Music (Island Press, 1965),  One\/eye\/love (Coach House Press, 1967), Light Verse (Coach House Press, 1969), Old Friends\u2019 Ghosts: Poems 1963-68 (Weed\/Flower, 1970), along with a dozen other titles. Victor Coleman was the director of the \u201cA Space\u201d (1975-1978), \u201c31 Mercer\u201d (1975-1978), Nightingale Arts Council in Toronto, the editor and writer for the Association of Non-Profit Artist-Run Centres, and has served as the director of the National Film Theatre in Kingston, Ontario. The poet also taught Creative Writing at both Queen's and York Universities. In 1995, as Coach House Press struggled, Coleman and Stan Bevington created Coach House Books to save the Press. In 2001, Victor Coleman became the Editorial Director for the Centre for Contemporary Canadian Art, a website devoted to the promotion of Canadian artists and writers. Victor Coleman continues to promote the development of avant-garde or postmodernist Canadian writing."

It's called \"For Basil Bunting\".\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:11:48\nReads \"For Basil Bunting\".\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:12:34\nI don't know whether any of you are familiar with a Japanese-English dictionary called Kenkyusha [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6389422], if not, all I can tell you is that it's a Japanese-English dictionary and that it has a strange quality to be able to predict the future, by chance operations in that it's very fat and you open it and you're like the guy with the funny hat at the track who really shouldn't be there because he can only guess and he just opens the racing form and sticks his finger on the horse and he bets on the horse and he usually loses. Kenkyusha is a little better than that because you're not trying to win anything, you're looking for some kind of instruction and the time I wrote these poems I was rather desperate for some kind of instruction, and uh, it's just a matter of opening the book, pointing and getting the epigraph for each poem from the Japanese-English dictionary. I'll just read a couple. \"Day Seven\", oh there are given days, that are sort of daily devotions.\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:14:09\nReads \"Day Seven\".\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:14:33\nReads \"Day Eight\".\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:15:19\nReads \"Day Ten\".\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:16:18\nMany of these relate to certain experiences with LSD also.\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:16:29\nReads \"Day Thirteen\".\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:16:49\nThe reason that the definitions, the English definitions in this section are so interesting and not like the ones we are accustomed to is because the characters that they represent go through their own changes and it's almost an ideogrammatic dictionary rather than a dictionary of definitions.\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:17:13\nResumes reading \u201cDay Thirteen\u201d.\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:20:17\nI need to get one of those spider clocks, can't read in this light.\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:20:39\nReads \"Day Twenty-One\" .\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:22:36\nReads \"Day Twenty-Two\".\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:24:56\nReads \"Day Twenty-Four\".\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:28:22\nThese next poems are the poems that are closest to me now. It's another long sequence called \"Separations\" and I don't think I need to give you any background on it. I'll not read the whole thing because it's quite long.\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:28:56\nReads \"Separations\u201d [parts 4-8, 10-12, and 14].\n \nVictor Coleman\n00:37:00\nThank you.\n \nEND\n00:37:17\n",

Layton and Dudek helped Aileen Collins found the magazine CIV\/n, and with Raymond Souster founded Contact Press in 1952, which both published many young Canadian poets like Margaret Atwood, Phyllis Webb, Eli Mandel, D.G. Jones, Alden Nowlan, Gwendolyn MacEwen, George Bowering, Frank Davey and John Newlove. Through Raymond Souster, he began correspondence with Robert Creeley in 1953, and continued to prove to American poets that Canadian poets had something interesting to say. Layton, Dudek and F.R. Scott promoted and mentored the newer generation of Canadian poets. He has become a Montreal icon, as he spent most of his life in the city.\n",

The last time he was up here was to introduce Robert Creeley [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q918620], and what was said then clearly explained the close relations between Mr. Layton and the Black Mountain Group [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2905420] in the 50's, so I won't go into that again, but I'll only add that Mr. Layton was a member of the editorial board of Black Mountain Review [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2905420] from 1955 on. Of course he's been publishing poetry since the 40's and was associated during those years with the First Statement Press, which became the Northern Review [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q15757902] in 1949, and all this time studying at McGill University [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q201492] where he received the M.A. in Political Science and Economics in 1946. It's impossible to list all of his appearances in periodicals and little magazines, and I'll mention only a few of his two dozen or so volumes of poetry, anyway that's what it seemed like to me when I looked at that page in the new one. A Red Carpet for the Sun in 1959, with the well-known introduction by William Carlos Williams [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q178106] which acknowledged, American recognition of Mr. Layton's reputation. A Red Carpet, like all of Mr. Layton's subsequent books was published by McClelland and Stewart [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6800322]. Then, a book of short stories and poems, The Swinging Flesh, which came out in 1961, Balls for a One-armed Juggler in 1963, The Laughing Rooster in 1964, Collected Poems in 1965 and his latest work, just published this winter, Periods of the Moon. And I should say the ones that I have mentioned are the ones which are still in stock and able to be bought. Among Mr. Layton's other frenetic activities, poetry readings in Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16], United States [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30], Germany [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q183] and elsewhere, television appearances, controversial ones and so on, he finds time to communicate with students as well as Poet in Residence of this university [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q326342]. I'd like to present Mr. Irving Layton.\n\nAudience\n00:02:21\nApplause.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:02:30\nThank you Howard, for your kind introduction. I'm glad that you did not introduce me as a letter writer. I'm very glad to see so large a turn out this evening. I am very heartened by it, very moved, and I'm very glad to see so many of my friends and former students in the audience. I like beginning my reading with a poem \"There Are No Signs\" because if any one poem expresses what I try to say, and all the poems and stories that I have written, is that modern man, pretty well, has to find out where he is going, by just going. Now the old sign posts are down, and that he must make his sign posts as he goes along.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:04:00\nReads \"There Are No Signs\" [published as \u201cThere Were No Signs in Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:04:51\n\"The Swimmer\", my symbol for the poet, condemned to live in two realms, and happy to live in neither of them. The realm of actuality and the realm of the imagination. Here I compare the poet to the swimmer.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:05:15\nReads \"The Swimmer\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:06:38\nSeveral years ago I taught at the Jewish Library, one of my students was a Mrs. Fornheim, who had lived in Vienna [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1741], and left Vienna when that city fell to the Nazis. She went to Paris [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q90], and left Paris for Spain [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q29], when the Vichy government was formed. From Spain, she went to Portugal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q45] and then came to Montreal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q340], where I taught her English. She died of cancer, this is my poem for her. \"Mrs. Fornheim, Refugee\".\n \nIrving Layton\n00:07:19\nReads \"Mrs. Fornheim, Refugee\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:08:12\n\"Gothic Landscape\", or what it means to be a Jewish boy growing up in a hostile neighbourhood of French Canadians and Italians who are convinced that you have lately murdered Christ. And where you are entranced by the church bells every Sunday, because of the ecstatic music over the sky, over the rooftops, and yet, in that ecstatic music of the bells, a sound of menace, something alien and frightening.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:09:00\nReads \"Gothic Landscape\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:10:19\n\"The Black Huntsmen\". This was written at a time when Jewish skin was made into lampshades. Or, the song of innocence becoming the song of experience.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:10:42\nReads \"The Black Huntsmen\" [from Collected Poems].\n\nUnknown\n00:12:07\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n\nIrving Layton\n00:12:08\nThis is how the fringes of a prayer shawl, a sheitel is a wig. If you are an Orthodox, Jewess as my mother was, you have to cut your hair very short and wear a wig so that you are no longer attractive so to speak, to any other man but your husband. Peculiar way of looking at it.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:12:43\nReads \"Archetypes\" [from Collected Poems].\n\nIrving Layton\n00:13:38\nReads \"Soleil de Noces\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:14:15\n\"De Bullion Street\". I don't suppose De Bullion Street has the reputation that it had when I was a boy. I suppose the present administration has cleaned up things, and anyway harlots now are more peripatetic. So this, in a sense, is an old fashioned poem.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:14:40\nReads \"De Bullion Street\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:16:10\n\"On My Way To School\" or the changes that come. I wasn't the most punctual of students, and it's a great comfort to me therefore when I was late to find a sign on a Baptist church \"Jesus Saves\". Many years, I returned and found some change had taken place and this poem celebrates the change, or records it.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:16:44\nReads \"On My Way To School\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:17:20\nReads \"Love the Conqueror Worm\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:18:31\n\"Vexata Quaestio\". Western man is the product we are told, of two traditions, the Greek, and the Hebrew. The Greek, pagan, believing that all experience is worth having, and man should refuse no experience. The Hebrew believing that the proper life, salvation is to be found in obedience to God's will. The two traditions are quite contradictory and can never be reconciled. It is our unfortunate destiny to try to reconcile them. I do not think we have been successful at it because the task cannot be done, it's impossible. So I've written this poem, \"Vexata Quaestio\" and what I'm saying is that each and every one of us in the West is a sort of compromise between these two traditions. Here I use the tree, a tall tree, as a symbol for the Hebraic, the Maccabean and the sun becomes a symbol for the pagan, and you'll see what happens to both the tree and the sun.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:20:11\nReads \"Vexata Quaestio\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:21:19\n\"Cemetery in August\". Only humans of course are aware of death, and even in August, when you feel the flush and thrill and intensity of life, you are aware of the autumn and the winter and when you are in a cemetery, the macabre juxtaposition of life and death becomes even more intense. So I wrote this poem, \"Cemetery in August\".\n \nIrving Layton\n00:21:54\nReads \"Cemetery in August\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:24:20\n\"To the Girls of my Graduating Class\". This was a graduating class, not at Sir George Williams, but my high school I taught several years ago. And I was very fortunate one year in having six very, very lovely, nubile adolescents, very attractive, and very, very well aware of precisely where attractions lay [audience laughter]. And very often when I was in the middle of a serious lecture in history, one of them would make some provocative gesture that would drive my thoughts from the lecture to something far more interesting [audience laughter].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:25:15\nReads \"To the Girls of my Graduating Class\" [from Collected Poems].\n\nAudience\n00:26:30\nLaughter.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:26:33\nAnd what you see when you are in the tavern, the kind of dreams you have about pleasure and about the strange, the strange dance that all of us lead. And this very queer life and journey of ours. And I call this \"Bacchanal\", and it's a rather unusual Bacchanal, because it's a rather sad one, or shall I say a prayerful one.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:27:10\nReads \"Bacchanal\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:28:18\nThis one is for my son, \"Maxie\".\n \nIrving Layton\n00:28:24\nReads \"Maxie\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:30:03\nAnd I suppose all teachers of literature have had the experience of giving an inspired lecture on Shakespeare [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q692] or John Donne [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q140412], and finding some hand at the back waving furiously as you're getting to the home stretch and your peroration is the most resounding thing that you've ever thought about but this hand out there, very insistent, you know, and finally you stop in the middle of the peroration and you say \"Yes, yes what is it?\" and the student says, \"Sir, will this be on the exam?\" [audience laughter].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:30:57\nReads \"Seven o'Clock Lecture\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:34:07\n\"The Birth of Tragedy\". The title is taken from one of the earliest books of Nietzsche [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q9358], the gods here that I speak about in the poem, are the gods of Dream and Dance, of Reason and Ecstasy, Apollo and Dionysus, Nietzsche held that tragedy came from the union of both dream and dance, intellect and impulse.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:34:44\nReads \"The Birth of Tragedy\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:36:44\nAnd I suppose no Layton reading would be quite complete without this poem, \"Misunderstanding\".\n \nIrving Layton\n00:36:54\nReads \"Misunderstanding\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:37:16\n\"The Cold Green Element\". This is about life, death, nature, and poetry. It's really a meditation, and, I hope, a passionate meditation on art and life. Like Yeats [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q40213], I am very concerned with the necessary antinomies or contradictions of life. Like Yeats, I believe that great art results from the happy, the miraculous fusion of the two.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:38:04\nReads \"The Cold Green Element\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:40:20\n\"The Improved Binoculars\", my symbol for science. It is truism to say that unless man's moral development, his capacity for sympathy, keeps space, or this development in science and technology he's in danger of blowing himself off the face of this earth. This poem is an apocalyptic poem, it is a vision of the future, such as I hope will never be realized. But in one of my more despairing moments, or one of my more savage and bitter moments, I wrote this poem, \"The Improved Binoculars\".\n \nIrving Layton\n00:41:05\nReads \"The Improved Binoculars\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:42:25\nReads [\u201cOrpheus\u201d from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:44:11\nReads \"Death of a Construction Worker\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:45:08\nReads \u201cTheology\u201d [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:45:47\nReads \u201cFor Louise, Age 17\u201d [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:47:14\n\"Song for Naomi\". Naomi's my daughter. Several years ago we were out in the country, I was appalled to find that while she was by the bank of the lake, I couldn't see her because the weeds and the flowers were taller than she was. If she fell into the lake, neither I nor my wife might see it. But nothing happened. Just a day before we were to pack up to leave, I noticed my daughter down by the lake, and this time, her dear little head was peeping just above the weeds and the flowers and this gave me the idea for this poem, which I wrote, while of course my wife did the packing.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:48:12\nReads \"Song for Naomi\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:49:47\nHere's a rather erotic poem, called \"Gathering of Poets\", to be taken of course with a grain of salt.\n \nUnknown\n00:49:59\n[Cut or edit made in tape].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:50:00\n...to be taken, of course, with a grain of salt. Just a short thing.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:50:08\nReads \"Gathering of Poets\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:50:40\nReads \"The Bull Calf\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:53:19\nAnd here's a lighter poem called \"Bargain\".\n \nIrving Layton\n00:53:22\nReads \"Bargain\" [from Collected Poems].\n\nAudience\n00:53:46\nLaughter.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:53:58\nThis next poem is for my mother, who died at the age of 89. She was a very remarkable woman, I'd like to tell you a great deal about her, she certainly merits it, she was a most remarkable character with a tremendous joie-de-vivre and a wonderful gift of vituperation, which it is said I have inherited [audience laughter]. Certainly I learned the cadence of poetry from my mother's cursing. My mother would start cursing as soon as I opened my eyes in the morning and wouldn't stop cursing until I closed them at night when I went to bed. But the cadence was what interested me [audience laughter] and I didn't pay any attention to words. Occasionally I would get the drift, of course, of what the curses were intended to say, and I must say it did me a wonderful lot of good because later on when I got knocked my critics and so on, it was like so much water off a duck's back after my mother's cursing. Nothing the critics say could possibly make any impression upon me whatsoever [audience laughter]. She was extremely vain of her black eyebrows. When she was 85, I was taking her somewhere and we stopped for a red light. I noticed a very lovely girl standing on the curb, and of course, I looked very intently at her. My mother caught my intent gaze and said, sighing, \"Yes, she's very beautiful, but has she got my black eyebrows?\" [audience laughter]. She wore earrings that were made of old Romanian coins, she wore an amber necklace, which I remember playing with when I was a child. But it was her immense vitality and joie-de-vivre, coupled with an immense discontent that always fascinated me about my mother. She was a very Orthodox woman, reverencing God, but often giving me the impression that she might have made a much better job of creation than God himself. So this is my tribute to my very, very remarkable mother.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:56:56\nReads \"Keine Lazarovitch, 1870-1959\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:59:16\nReads \"The Well-Wrought Urn\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:59:57\nSome time ago, I went down to the church at Notre Dame, and you know, you have halos lighting up over the head of your favourite saint, or the Virgin Mary, if you drop the requisite number of coins. There's nobody else in that vast gloomy church, except another man and myself, and he went over to the little machine and he dropped some coins, and he waited for the halo to light up and it didn't. And that nettled him a great deal, and he waited, and it still didn't light up so he gave the machine a kick, nothing happened. But he said something and I went home and I wrote this poem.\n \nIrving Layton\n01:01:01\nReads \"This Machine Age\" [from Collected Poems; audience laughter throughout].\n \nIrving Layton\n01:02:09\nThis next poem of mine is also based on an actual experience, I'm sure that most of you have heard of Djilas [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q153909], the very courageous Yugoslav writer who's imprisoned by his erstwhile comrade and companion in arms, Tito. He's imprisoned for writing and publishing outside of the country, Conversations with Stalin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5166446]. That was several years ago, he's just been released. Well I thought a brave man like that deserves some kind of support, especially from and by writers, and so I decided to go up to Ottawa [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1930] and demonstrate in front of the Yugoslav Embassy. I took my wife with me, and one or two of the local poets, we made some signs and we drove up to Ottawa. We got out of the car, and the sign read, of course, \"Free Djilas\", and I was amazed and delighted to find that a considerable crowd gathered around me and the sign. Until I realized just what was happening. And so I wrote this poem, called \"Free Djilas\".\n \nIrving Layton\n01:03:31\nReads \"Free Djilas\" [from Collected Poems; audience laughter throughout].\n \nIrving Layton\n01:04:29\nThis one, in a more serious vein, \"The Predator\".\n \nIrving Layton\n01:04:36\nReads \"The Predator\" [from Collected Poems].\n\nIrving Layton\n01:06:41\nReads \"Plaza de Toros\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n01:09:13\nReads \"At the Alhambra\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n01:10:20\nReads \"For My Green Old Age\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n01:11:44\nNow I want to read a few poems from my most recent book, Periods of the Moon. \"Castles on the Rhine\".\n \nIrving Layton\n01:12:01\nReads \"Castles on the Rhine\" [published as \u201cRhine Boat Trip in Periods of the Moon].\n \nIrving Layton\n01:12:54\nReads \"Mutability\" from Periods of the Moon.\n \nIrving Layton\n01:14:19\nReads \"Time's Velvet Tongue\" from Periods of the Moon.\n \nIrving Layton\n01:15:20\nReads \"Gratitude\" from Periods of the Moon.\n\nAudience\n01:16:00\nLaughter \n\nIrving Layton\n01:16:04\nMy contribution to the centennial year, \u201cConfederation Ode\u201d.\n\nIrving Layton\n01:16:10\nReads \"Confederation Ode\" from Periods of the Moon [audience laughter throughout].\n\nAudience\n01:17:23\nLaughter and Applause.\n \nIrving Layton\n01:17:34\nReads \"The Beautiful Unknown Girl\" from Periods of the Moon.\n \nIrving Layton\n01:18:55\nAnd this one, \"For Musia's Grandchildren\".\n \nIrving Layton\n01:19:09\nReads \"For Musia's Grandchildren\" from Periods of the Moon.\n \nIrving Layton\n01:20:59\nReads \"Look Homeward, Angel\" from Periods of the Moon.\n \nIrving Layton\n01:21:45\nAnd this last one, \"Family Portrait\".\n \nIrving Layton\n01:21:54\nReads \"Family Portrait\" [from Collected Poems; audience laughter throughout].\n\nAudience\n01:22:59\nLaughter and Applause.\n \nEND\n01:23:43\n"

                "notes": "Canadian poet Irving Layton was born Israel Lazarovitch in Romania on March 12, 1913. His parents moved to Montreal when he was an infant. He attended Baron Byng High School, and then received a B.Sc. in agriculture in 1939 at MacDonald College. He completed an M.A. in 1946 in economics and political science at McGill University. At McGill, Layton began publishing his poetry in 1943 in First Statement, joining John Sutherland and Louis Dudek on the editorial board, and was involved with Northern Review from 1945-1956. Irving Layton was a founding member of Contact Press, along with Dudek and Raymond Souster in 1952. Layton\u2019s first collection of poems began with Here and now (First Statement, 1945), followed by Now is the place (First Statement, 1948), The black huntsman (Contact Press [?], 1951), Love the conqueror worm (Contact Press, 1953), In the midst of my fever (published by Robert Creeley for Divers Press in 1954), The long pea-shooter (Laocoon Press, 1954), The cold green element and The blue propeller (Contact Press, 1955), The bull calf and other poems, Music on a Kazoo and The improved binoculars (published with an introduction by William Carlos Williams, Contact Press and J.Williams Press, 1956), A laughter in the mind (J.

Layton also taught part time at Sir George University (now Concordia University) which appointed him poet-in-residence in 1965. Producing an average of one collection of poems per year, Layton published The swinging flesh (1961), Balls for a one-armed juggler (1963), The laughing rooster (1964), Collected poems (1965), Periods of the moon (1967), The shattered plinths (1968), The whole bloody bird: obs, alphs, and poems (1969), Nail polish (1971), Lovers and lesser men (1973), The pole vaulter (1974), For my brother Jesus (1976), The covenant (1977), The tightrope dancer (1978), Droppings from heaven (1979), For my neighbours in hell (Mosaic Press, 1980), Europe and other bad news (1981), The Gucci bag (1983), and Fortunate exile (1987), all published by McClelland and Stewart Press unless otherwise indicated.

Layton has edited dozens of anthologies of Canadian poems and prose, as well as having his poetry published internationally. Layton ended his teaching career at York University in Toronto. An influential part of Canada\u2019s literary scene, Irving Layton died on January 4, 2006."

                "contents": "Howard Fink\n00:00:00\n...Irving Layton [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1673289] to this stage again tonight, this time to read his poetry. The last time he was up here was to introduce Robert Creeley [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q918620], and what was said then clearly explained the close relations between Mr. Layton and the Black Mountain Group [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2905420] in the 50's, so I won't go into that again, but I'll only add that Mr. Layton was a member of the editorial board of Black Mountain Review [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2905420] from 1955 on. Of course he's been publishing poetry since the 40's and was associated during those years with the First Statement Press, which became the Northern Review [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q15757902] in 1949, and all this time studying at McGill University [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q201492] where he received the M.A. in Political Science and Economics in 1946. It's impossible to list all of his appearances in periodicals and little magazines, and I'll mention only a few of his two dozen or so volumes of poetry, anyway that's what it seemed like to me when I looked at that page in the new one. A Red Carpet for the Sun in 1959, with the well-known introduction by William Carlos Williams [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q178106] which acknowledged, American recognition of Mr. Layton's reputation. A Red Carpet, like all of Mr. Layton's subsequent books was published by McClelland and Stewart [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6800322]. Then, a book of short stories and poems, The Swinging Flesh, which came out in 1961, Balls for a One-armed Juggler in 1963, The Laughing Rooster in 1964, Collected Poems in 1965 and his latest work, just published this winter, Periods of the Moon. And I should say the ones that I have mentioned are the ones which are still in stock and able to be bought. Among Mr. Layton's other frenetic activities, poetry readings in Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16], United States [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30], Germany [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q183] and elsewhere, television appearances, controversial ones and so on, he finds time to communicate with students as well as Poet in Residence of this university [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q326342]. I'd like to present Mr. Irving Layton.\n\nAudience\n00:02:21\nApplause.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:02:30\nThank you Howard, for your kind introduction. I'm glad that you did not introduce me as a letter writer. I'm very glad to see so large a turn out this evening. I am very heartened by it, very moved, and I'm very glad to see so many of my friends and former students in the audience. I like beginning my reading with a poem \"There Are No Signs\" because if any one poem expresses what I try to say, and all the poems and stories that I have written, is that modern man, pretty well, has to find out where he is going, by just going. Now the old sign posts are down, and that he must make his sign posts as he goes along.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:04:00\nReads \"There Are No Signs\" [published as \u201cThere Were No Signs in Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:04:51\n\"The Swimmer\", my symbol for the poet, condemned to live in two realms, and happy to live in neither of them. The realm of actuality and the realm of the imagination. Here I compare the poet to the swimmer.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:05:15\nReads \"The Swimmer\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:06:38\nSeveral years ago I taught at the Jewish Library, one of my students was a Mrs. Fornheim, who had lived in Vienna [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1741], and left Vienna when that city fell to the Nazis. She went to Paris [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q90], and left Paris for Spain [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q29], when the Vichy government was formed. From Spain, she went to Portugal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q45] and then came to Montreal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q340], where I taught her English. She died of cancer, this is my poem for her. \"Mrs. Fornheim, Refugee\".\n \nIrving Layton\n00:07:19\nReads \"Mrs. Fornheim, Refugee\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:08:12\n\"Gothic Landscape\", or what it means to be a Jewish boy growing up in a hostile neighbourhood of French Canadians and Italians who are convinced that you have lately murdered Christ. And where you are entranced by the church bells every Sunday, because of the ecstatic music over the sky, over the rooftops, and yet, in that ecstatic music of the bells, a sound of menace, something alien and frightening.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:09:00\nReads \"Gothic Landscape\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:10:19\n\"The Black Huntsmen\". This was written at a time when Jewish skin was made into lampshades. Or, the song of innocence becoming the song of experience.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:10:42\nReads \"The Black Huntsmen\" [from Collected Poems].\n\nUnknown\n00:12:07\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n\nIrving Layton\n00:12:08\nThis is how the fringes of a prayer shawl, a sheitel is a wig. If you are an Orthodox, Jewess as my mother was, you have to cut your hair very short and wear a wig so that you are no longer attractive so to speak, to any other man but your husband. Peculiar way of looking at it.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:12:43\nReads \"Archetypes\" [from Collected Poems].\n\nIrving Layton\n00:13:38\nReads \"Soleil de Noces\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:14:15\n\"De Bullion Street\". I don't suppose De Bullion Street has the reputation that it had when I was a boy. I suppose the present administration has cleaned up things, and anyway harlots now are more peripatetic. So this, in a sense, is an old fashioned poem.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:14:40\nReads \"De Bullion Street\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:16:10\n\"On My Way To School\" or the changes that come. I wasn't the most punctual of students, and it's a great comfort to me therefore when I was late to find a sign on a Baptist church \"Jesus Saves\". Many years, I returned and found some change had taken place and this poem celebrates the change, or records it.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:16:44\nReads \"On My Way To School\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:17:20\nReads \"Love the Conqueror Worm\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:18:31\n\"Vexata Quaestio\". Western man is the product we are told, of two traditions, the Greek, and the Hebrew. The Greek, pagan, believing that all experience is worth having, and man should refuse no experience. The Hebrew believing that the proper life, salvation is to be found in obedience to God's will. The two traditions are quite contradictory and can never be reconciled. It is our unfortunate destiny to try to reconcile them. I do not think we have been successful at it because the task cannot be done, it's impossible. So I've written this poem, \"Vexata Quaestio\" and what I'm saying is that each and every one of us in the West is a sort of compromise between these two traditions. Here I use the tree, a tall tree, as a symbol for the Hebraic, the Maccabean and the sun becomes a symbol for the pagan, and you'll see what happens to both the tree and the sun.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:20:11\nReads \"Vexata Quaestio\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:21:19\n\"Cemetery in August\". Only humans of course are aware of death, and even in August, when you feel the flush and thrill and intensity of life, you are aware of the autumn and the winter and when you are in a cemetery, the macabre juxtaposition of life and death becomes even more intense. So I wrote this poem, \"Cemetery in August\".\n \nIrving Layton\n00:21:54\nReads \"Cemetery in August\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:24:20\n\"To the Girls of my Graduating Class\". This was a graduating class, not at Sir George Williams, but my high school I taught several years ago. And I was very fortunate one year in having six very, very lovely, nubile adolescents, very attractive, and very, very well aware of precisely where attractions lay [audience laughter]. And very often when I was in the middle of a serious lecture in history, one of them would make some provocative gesture that would drive my thoughts from the lecture to something far more interesting [audience laughter].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:25:15\nReads \"To the Girls of my Graduating Class\" [from Collected Poems].\n\nAudience\n00:26:30\nLaughter.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:26:33\nAnd what you see when you are in the tavern, the kind of dreams you have about pleasure and about the strange, the strange dance that all of us lead. And this very queer life and journey of ours. And I call this \"Bacchanal\", and it's a rather unusual Bacchanal, because it's a rather sad one, or shall I say a prayerful one.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:27:10\nReads \"Bacchanal\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:28:18\nThis one is for my son, \"Maxie\".\n \nIrving Layton\n00:28:24\nReads \"Maxie\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:30:03\nAnd I suppose all teachers of literature have had the experience of giving an inspired lecture on Shakespeare [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q692] or John Donne [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q140412], and finding some hand at the back waving furiously as you're getting to the home stretch and your peroration is the most resounding thing that you've ever thought about but this hand out there, very insistent, you know, and finally you stop in the middle of the peroration and you say \"Yes, yes what is it?\" and the student says, \"Sir, will this be on the exam?\" [audience laughter].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:30:57\nReads \"Seven o'Clock Lecture\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:34:07\n\"The Birth of Tragedy\". The title is taken from one of the earliest books of Nietzsche [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q9358], the gods here that I speak about in the poem, are the gods of Dream and Dance, of Reason and Ecstasy, Apollo and Dionysus, Nietzsche held that tragedy came from the union of both dream and dance, intellect and impulse.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:34:44\nReads \"The Birth of Tragedy\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:36:44\nAnd I suppose no Layton reading would be quite complete without this poem, \"Misunderstanding\".\n \nIrving Layton\n00:36:54\nReads \"Misunderstanding\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:37:16\n\"The Cold Green Element\". This is about life, death, nature, and poetry. It's really a meditation, and, I hope, a passionate meditation on art and life. Like Yeats [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q40213], I am very concerned with the necessary antinomies or contradictions of life. Like Yeats, I believe that great art results from the happy, the miraculous fusion of the two.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:38:04\nReads \"The Cold Green Element\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:40:20\n\"The Improved Binoculars\", my symbol for science. It is truism to say that unless man's moral development, his capacity for sympathy, keeps space, or this development in science and technology he's in danger of blowing himself off the face of this earth. This poem is an apocalyptic poem, it is a vision of the future, such as I hope will never be realized. But in one of my more despairing moments, or one of my more savage and bitter moments, I wrote this poem, \"The Improved Binoculars\".\n \nIrving Layton\n00:41:05\nReads \"The Improved Binoculars\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:42:25\nReads [\u201cOrpheus\u201d from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:44:11\nReads \"Death of a Construction Worker\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:45:08\nReads \u201cTheology\u201d [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:45:47\nReads \u201cFor Louise, Age 17\u201d [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:47:14\n\"Song for Naomi\". Naomi's my daughter. Several years ago we were out in the country, I was appalled to find that while she was by the bank of the lake, I couldn't see her because the weeds and the flowers were taller than she was. If she fell into the lake, neither I nor my wife might see it. But nothing happened. Just a day before we were to pack up to leave, I noticed my daughter down by the lake, and this time, her dear little head was peeping just above the weeds and the flowers and this gave me the idea for this poem, which I wrote, while of course my wife did the packing.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:48:12\nReads \"Song for Naomi\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:49:47\nHere's a rather erotic poem, called \"Gathering of Poets\", to be taken of course with a grain of salt.\n \nUnknown\n00:49:59\n[Cut or edit made in tape].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:50:00\n...to be taken, of course, with a grain of salt. Just a short thing.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:50:08\nReads \"Gathering of Poets\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:50:40\nReads \"The Bull Calf\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:53:19\nAnd here's a lighter poem called \"Bargain\".\n \nIrving Layton\n00:53:22\nReads \"Bargain\" [from Collected Poems].\n\nAudience\n00:53:46\nLaughter.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:53:58\nThis next poem is for my mother, who died at the age of 89. She was a very remarkable woman, I'd like to tell you a great deal about her, she certainly merits it, she was a most remarkable character with a tremendous joie-de-vivre and a wonderful gift of vituperation, which it is said I have inherited [audience laughter]. Certainly I learned the cadence of poetry from my mother's cursing. My mother would start cursing as soon as I opened my eyes in the morning and wouldn't stop cursing until I closed them at night when I went to bed. But the cadence was what interested me [audience laughter] and I didn't pay any attention to words. Occasionally I would get the drift, of course, of what the curses were intended to say, and I must say it did me a wonderful lot of good because later on when I got knocked my critics and so on, it was like so much water off a duck's back after my mother's cursing. Nothing the critics say could possibly make any impression upon me whatsoever [audience laughter]. She was extremely vain of her black eyebrows. When she was 85, I was taking her somewhere and we stopped for a red light. I noticed a very lovely girl standing on the curb, and of course, I looked very intently at her. My mother caught my intent gaze and said, sighing, \"Yes, she's very beautiful, but has she got my black eyebrows?\" [audience laughter]. She wore earrings that were made of old Romanian coins, she wore an amber necklace, which I remember playing with when I was a child. But it was her immense vitality and joie-de-vivre, coupled with an immense discontent that always fascinated me about my mother. She was a very Orthodox woman, reverencing God, but often giving me the impression that she might have made a much better job of creation than God himself. So this is my tribute to my very, very remarkable mother.\n \nIrving Layton\n00:56:56\nReads \"Keine Lazarovitch, 1870-1959\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:59:16\nReads \"The Well-Wrought Urn\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n00:59:57\nSome time ago, I went down to the church at Notre Dame, and you know, you have halos lighting up over the head of your favourite saint, or the Virgin Mary, if you drop the requisite number of coins. There's nobody else in that vast gloomy church, except another man and myself, and he went over to the little machine and he dropped some coins, and he waited for the halo to light up and it didn't. And that nettled him a great deal, and he waited, and it still didn't light up so he gave the machine a kick, nothing happened. But he said something and I went home and I wrote this poem.\n \nIrving Layton\n01:01:01\nReads \"This Machine Age\" [from Collected Poems; audience laughter throughout].\n \nIrving Layton\n01:02:09\nThis next poem of mine is also based on an actual experience, I'm sure that most of you have heard of Djilas [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q153909], the very courageous Yugoslav writer who's imprisoned by his erstwhile comrade and companion in arms, Tito. He's imprisoned for writing and publishing outside of the country, Conversations with Stalin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5166446]. That was several years ago, he's just been released. Well I thought a brave man like that deserves some kind of support, especially from and by writers, and so I decided to go up to Ottawa [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1930] and demonstrate in front of the Yugoslav Embassy. I took my wife with me, and one or two of the local poets, we made some signs and we drove up to Ottawa. We got out of the car, and the sign read, of course, \"Free Djilas\", and I was amazed and delighted to find that a considerable crowd gathered around me and the sign. Until I realized just what was happening. And so I wrote this poem, called \"Free Djilas\".\n \nIrving Layton\n01:03:31\nReads \"Free Djilas\" [from Collected Poems; audience laughter throughout].\n \nIrving Layton\n01:04:29\nThis one, in a more serious vein, \"The Predator\".\n \nIrving Layton\n01:04:36\nReads \"The Predator\" [from Collected Poems].\n\nIrving Layton\n01:06:41\nReads \"Plaza de Toros\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n01:09:13\nReads \"At the Alhambra\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n01:10:20\nReads \"For My Green Old Age\" [from Collected Poems].\n \nIrving Layton\n01:11:44\nNow I want to read a few poems from my most recent book, Periods of the Moon. \"Castles on the Rhine\".\n \nIrving Layton\n01:12:01\nReads \"Castles on the Rhine\" [published as \u201cRhine Boat Trip in Periods of the Moon].\n \nIrving Layton\n01:12:54\nReads \"Mutability\" from Periods of the Moon.\n \nIrving Layton\n01:14:19\nReads \"Time's Velvet Tongue\" from Periods of the Moon.\n \nIrving Layton\n01:15:20\nReads \"Gratitude\" from Periods of the Moon.\n\nAudience\n01:16:00\nLaughter \n\nIrving Layton\n01:16:04\nMy contribution to the centennial year, \u201cConfederation Ode\u201d.\n\nIrving Layton\n01:16:10\nReads \"Confederation Ode\" from Periods of the Moon [audience laughter throughout].\n\nAudience\n01:17:23\nLaughter and Applause.\n \nIrving Layton\n01:17:34\nReads \"The Beautiful Unknown Girl\" from Periods of the Moon.\n \nIrving Layton\n01:18:55\nAnd this one, \"For Musia's Grandchildren\".\n \nIrving Layton\n01:19:09\nReads \"For Musia's Grandchildren\" from Periods of the Moon.\n \nIrving Layton\n01:20:59\nReads \"Look Homeward, Angel\" from Periods of the Moon.\n \nIrving Layton\n01:21:45\nAnd this last one, \"Family Portrait\".\n \nIrving Layton\n01:21:54\nReads \"Family Portrait\" [from Collected Poems; audience laughter throughout].\n\nAudience\n01:22:59\nLaughter and Applause.\n \nEND\n01:23:43\n",

First of all, I want to reassure everyone that I'm not going to read everything that's in this. I feel that probably there are some who are terrified when they see this, you know. It's really basically laziness that I haven't shortened anything out, I simply have wads of things here. \n \nAudience\n00:24:55\nLaughter.\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:24:56\nNo no, not that one, I'm not going to read them all, definitely, definitely not. \n \nUnknown\n00:25:09\nSilence [pause].\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:25:19\nFirst of all I have a very, very bad poem that I can't resist reading. I realized that it's sort of a bad beginning to start off with a poem that the poet himself considers a very bad one, but I wrote this when I arrived here this afternoon. To the natural egotism of a poet, you see, I can't resist offering it to this sort of captive audience here. [Audience laughter]. \"Poem for the Ritz Carlton\". [Audience laughter].\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:26:06\nReads \"Poem for the Ritz Carlton\" [audience laughter throughout].\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:26:30\nThat isn't really as critical of the Ritz Carlton as it sounds, because I sort of like the crypt of St. Paul's Cathedral [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q173882], too, you see. [Audience laughter]. Next, I'd like to read some poems from my new book, Bread Wine and Salt, which is going to be published by Carter when, the first week in November, at three dollars and fifty cents. [Audience laughter]. That is the commercial.  \"I, Icarus\".\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:27:15\nReads \"I, Icarus\" [from Bread, Wine and Salt].\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:28:34\nReads \"Sailors\" [from Bread, Wine and Salt].\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:30:06\nThis poem is entitled \"The Cinnamon Bears\", which sounds at first as if it were some sort of an animal cooking. But actually, what these cinnamon bears were, was back around the turn of the century in New Brunswick [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1965], as I've been told, there were all sorts of touring side-show type of things, you know, that, fortune tellers, and...people with a monkey, organ grinders with a monkey, and all this type of, sort of strolling pyres or wandering minstrels that existed up until the advent of radio and television. And it was a terrific thing, of course, in these backwoods communities. No doubt throughout Canada and the United States, when one of these people arrived. And among the, among these people were men who had trained bears, who, because of their colouration, were called cinnamon bears. And this poem actually is sort of a found poem, because it's not so much a creative thing as it is the transcription of a conversation which I happened to overhear between an old couple in northern New Brunswick. A man and his wife in their seventies, when they, suddenly something brought back these memories of these days of the organ grinders and the cinnamon bears. And as I say, I sort of made the poem more or less by simply transcribing the things which they said to one another, which it seemed to me was sort of a poetry, a form of poetry itself. \n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:32:20\nReads \"The Cinnamon Bears\" [from Bread, Wine and Salt].\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:33:21\nReads \"Britain Street, St. John, New Brunswick\u201d [published as \u201cBritain Street\u201d in Bread, Wine and Salt].\n\nAlden Nowlan\n00:34:22\nThis is another, sort of a found poem, I'm not really terribly convinced that it's a poem at all. Last year, when I had a quite serious illness, one afternoon I was in the waiting room at the doctor's office, and the only thing that seemed to lay at hand for me to read was a copy of one of these Confessions magazines entitled Secret Life. [Audience laughter]. And as I glanced through it, it seemed to me, all that I actually read of it, you know, were these sort of captions at the top of the articles, and some of the big type in it. But it seemed to me really, as I glanced through it, that it had, that it contained sort of a crazy poetry of its own. At least, in the mood that I was in at the time, I sort of responded to it as though it were a crazy sort of poetry. And so as I sat there I sort of jotted down some of these things from the magazine, and ever since I've been trying to pass it off as a poem. \n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:35:37\nReads \"Secret Life\" [from Bread, Wine and Salt; audience laughter throughout].\n \nAudience\n00:36:39\nLaughter. \n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:36:57\nReads \"In Our Time\" [from Bread, Wine and Salt].\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:40:51\nReads \"The Changeling\" [from Bread, Wine and Salt].\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:41:49\nReads \"The Hollow Men\" [from Bread, Wine and Salt].\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:42:38\nThis poem is entitled \"Ancestral Memories Evoked by Attending the Opening of the Playhouse in Fredericton [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2138], New Brunswick\". And I'm a little afraid that many of you will feel that it is sort of pointless. I'm not sure really but what you'd have to be completely immersed in the atmosphere of New Brunswick to get the real point of it, but. But that said, not implying any superiority on the part of New Brunswickers, unfortunately. Anyway.\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:43:26\nReads \"Ancestral Memories Evoked by Attending the Opening of the Playhouse in Fredericton, New Brunswick\" [from Bread, Wine and Salt].\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:44:36\nReads \"Every Man Owes God a Death\" [from Bread, Wine and Salt].\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:46:41\nThis poem, for no particular reason, is entitled \"The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner\". \n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:46:48\nReads \"The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner\" [from Bread, Wine and Salt].\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:48:23\nThis is a poem that came out of a serious illness that I had last year, and it's entitled \"In the Operating Room\". \n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:48:38\nReads \"In the Operating Room\" [from Bread, Wine and Salt].\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:50:05\nI have a few other recent poems I'll dig out of these. \n \nUnknown\n00:50:12\nAmbient Sound [pause; Nowlan turning pages].\n\nAlden Nowlan\n00:50:47\nAs I sort through these, I'm silently cursing myself for not having done this before I came here. \n \nUnknown\n00:50:52\nAmbient Sound [pause; Nowlan turning pages].\n\nAlden Nowlan\n00:51:20\nHere's a fairly recent poem which isn't a political poem at all, but a human poem. And one that I wrote as a result of watching on television the debates in the United Nations [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1065] on the Middle East [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7204] crisis. And one of the horrible things I felt as I watched it was how completely dehumanized it all was, that the real, human issues had been lost sight of, and sort of drowned in an ocean of resolutions and memos from embassies and all this sort of things. And one night when they televised these sessions through until about four o'clock, the ambassador of Saudi Arabia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q851] spoke, and he delivered certainly a very bigoted speech, and one that as a speech I wouldn't have agreed with, but I felt an admiration for him, because it had seemed to me that he was the only really human thing that had happened there all day. You know, that certainly he was a bigoted old man, full of thousands of years of hatred, but it was a human hatred, expressed in a human manner, something that the rest of them had completely lost sight of. And as a result of this feeling I wrote this poem, \"For Jamil Baroody [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q96384169], Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the United Nations on the Occasion of his Address to the Security Council, June 1967\".\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:53:21\nReads \"For Jamil Baroody, Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the United Nations on the Occasion of his Address to the Security Council, June 1967\".\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:56:26\nReads \"Fireworks\".\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:57:34\nReads \"Two Poems for the Nova Scotia Department of Highways\".\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:59:31\nFinally, this is a poem entitled \"State Visit\", and the motivation of it, like one of the earlier ones I read, was sort of this same feeling of frustration at the complete dehumanization of politics as we feel it today, and particularly, this sort of apotheosis of world leaders into some sort of a symbol, so they even, I think, begin to think of themselves in these sort of abstract terms, rather than as a human being. And out of--this is sort of, I suppose, perhaps to a degree sort of a bitter little poem, but it stemmed from an emotion which I'm sure many of us feel. \n \nAlden Nowlan\n01:00:27\nReads \"State Visit\".\n \nEND\n01:01:39\n[Cut off abruptly]."

                "notes": "Internationally acclaimed novelist, poet, critic and activist Margaret Atwood was born in Ottawa, Ontario, November 18,  1939. She lived in Ottawa until 1946, when her family settled in Leaside, a suburb of Toronto. Atwood entered Victoria College, University of Toronto, graduating with honours in 1961. Her first published collection of short stories was Double Persephone (Hawkshead Press, 1961). By 1962 she had received her MA in English from Radcliffe College in the United States, working on further graduate work at Harvard University between 1962-3 and in 1965-7. Atwood published her second collection, The Circle Game (Anansi, 1966), which won the Governor General Award for Poetry. She wrote articles and reviews for Alphabet, Canadian Literature and Poetry among other publications, and poems for Kayak, Quarry and the Tamarack Review. Poems published in her book The Animals in That Country (Oxford University Press, 1968) won first prize in Canada\u2019s 1967 Centennial Commission poetry competition. In 1970, she published three books, Procedures for Underground (Oxford University Press), Time, and The Journals of Susanna Moodie (Oxford University Press). Between 1971 and 1973, Atwood worked as an editor and on the board of directors for the House of Anansi press in Toronto, which in 1972 published Power Politics. Upon the discovery at Harvard that there was no published critical study of Canadian literature, she herself wrote and published Survival: A Thematic Guide to Canadian Literature (Anansi, 1971), which created a stir of controversy, but by 1982 it had sold more than 85,000 copies. Since 1973, she has lived with novelist and activist Graeme Gibson, producing one daughter, Eleanor Jess in 1967. Atwood taught and lectured at several Universities across Canada, the US and Australia, including University of British Columbia, University of Alberta, Sir George Williams University (now Concordia) (1967-68) and at York University, Toronto. A selection of her publications include Surfacing (Simon & Schuster, 1972), You Are Happy (Harper &Row, 1974), Selected Poems (Oxford University Press) in 1976, Two-Headed Poems (Simon & Schuster, 1978), True Stories (Oxford University Press, 1981) and Second Words (Anansi, 1982). Her 1985 novel, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale (McClelland & Stewart) became one of her most popular and critically acclaimed works. In 1986 she was appointed the Berg Chair at New York University, as well as serving as writer-in-residence at several other Universities. She co-founded and served as chair to the Writer\u2019s Union of Canada in 1982-3, and served as president of the Canadian Centre of International PEN from 1984-6. She has subsequently published dozens of books, including Cat\u2019s Eye (McClelland & Stewart, 1988), The Robber Bride (Doubleday, 1993), Alias Grace (Nan A. Talese, 1996), The Blind Assassin (Nan A. Talese, 2000), Oryx and Crake (2003), The Penelopiad (Canongate, 2005) and The Tent (Bloomsbury, 2006). Along with many other publications of her critical essays, Curious Pursuits: Occasional Writing 1970-2005 (Verago) came out in 2005. Her most recent novel, Year of the Flood was published in 2009 by Doubleday Press. Her many prizes and honours include the Booker Prize, the E.J.

Nowlan was also involved in theatre, and wrote three stage plays with Walter Learning: Frankenstein (Clarke, Irwin, 1976), The incredible murder of Cardinal Tosca (Learning Productions, 1978) and The dollar woman (Borealis Press, 1981). Nowlan was awarded a Doctor of Letters from the University of New Brunswick, and a Guggenheim Fellowship. Nowlan has also published an autobiography, Various persons named Kevin O\u2019Brien (Clarke, Irwin, 1973), a collection of short stories, Miracle at Indian River (Clarke, Irwin, 1968), a travel book Campobello, the outer island (Clarke, Irwin, 1975) and collected twenty-seven of his magazine articles in Double exposure (Brunswick Press, 1978). Numerous titles were published posthumously, including Alden Nowlan, early poems (Fiddlehead Poetry Books, 1983), The best of Alden Nowlan (Lancelot Press, 1993), Will ye let the mummers in?

Ladies and gentlemen, Alden Nowlan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4713563].\n \nAudience\n00:24:17\nApplause.\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:24:26\nThank you, Roy [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3445789]. First of all, I want to reassure everyone that I'm not going to read everything that's in this. I feel that probably there are some who are terrified when they see this, you know. It's really basically laziness that I haven't shortened anything out, I simply have wads of things here. \n \nAudience\n00:24:55\nLaughter.\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:24:56\nNo no, not that one, I'm not going to read them all, definitely, definitely not. \n \nUnknown\n00:25:09\nSilence [pause].\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:25:19\nFirst of all I have a very, very bad poem that I can't resist reading. I realized that it's sort of a bad beginning to start off with a poem that the poet himself considers a very bad one, but I wrote this when I arrived here this afternoon. To the natural egotism of a poet, you see, I can't resist offering it to this sort of captive audience here. [Audience laughter]. \"Poem for the Ritz Carlton\". [Audience laughter].\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:26:06\nReads \"Poem for the Ritz Carlton\" [audience laughter throughout].\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:26:30\nThat isn't really as critical of the Ritz Carlton as it sounds, because I sort of like the crypt of St. Paul's Cathedral [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q173882], too, you see. [Audience laughter]. Next, I'd like to read some poems from my new book, Bread Wine and Salt, which is going to be published by Carter when, the first week in November, at three dollars and fifty cents. [Audience laughter]. That is the commercial.  \"I, Icarus\".\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:27:15\nReads \"I, Icarus\" [from Bread, Wine and Salt].\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:28:34\nReads \"Sailors\" [from Bread, Wine and Salt].\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:30:06\nThis poem is entitled \"The Cinnamon Bears\", which sounds at first as if it were some sort of an animal cooking. But actually, what these cinnamon bears were, was back around the turn of the century in New Brunswick [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1965], as I've been told, there were all sorts of touring side-show type of things, you know, that, fortune tellers, and...people with a monkey, organ grinders with a monkey, and all this type of, sort of strolling pyres or wandering minstrels that existed up until the advent of radio and television. And it was a terrific thing, of course, in these backwoods communities. No doubt throughout Canada and the United States, when one of these people arrived. And among the, among these people were men who had trained bears, who, because of their colouration, were called cinnamon bears. And this poem actually is sort of a found poem, because it's not so much a creative thing as it is the transcription of a conversation which I happened to overhear between an old couple in northern New Brunswick. A man and his wife in their seventies, when they, suddenly something brought back these memories of these days of the organ grinders and the cinnamon bears. And as I say, I sort of made the poem more or less by simply transcribing the things which they said to one another, which it seemed to me was sort of a poetry, a form of poetry itself. \n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:32:20\nReads \"The Cinnamon Bears\" [from Bread, Wine and Salt].\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:33:21\nReads \"Britain Street, St. John, New Brunswick\u201d [published as \u201cBritain Street\u201d in Bread, Wine and Salt].\n\nAlden Nowlan\n00:34:22\nThis is another, sort of a found poem, I'm not really terribly convinced that it's a poem at all. Last year, when I had a quite serious illness, one afternoon I was in the waiting room at the doctor's office, and the only thing that seemed to lay at hand for me to read was a copy of one of these Confessions magazines entitled Secret Life. [Audience laughter]. And as I glanced through it, it seemed to me, all that I actually read of it, you know, were these sort of captions at the top of the articles, and some of the big type in it. But it seemed to me really, as I glanced through it, that it had, that it contained sort of a crazy poetry of its own. At least, in the mood that I was in at the time, I sort of responded to it as though it were a crazy sort of poetry. And so as I sat there I sort of jotted down some of these things from the magazine, and ever since I've been trying to pass it off as a poem. \n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:35:37\nReads \"Secret Life\" [from Bread, Wine and Salt; audience laughter throughout].\n \nAudience\n00:36:39\nLaughter. \n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:36:57\nReads \"In Our Time\" [from Bread, Wine and Salt].\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:40:51\nReads \"The Changeling\" [from Bread, Wine and Salt].\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:41:49\nReads \"The Hollow Men\" [from Bread, Wine and Salt].\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:42:38\nThis poem is entitled \"Ancestral Memories Evoked by Attending the Opening of the Playhouse in Fredericton [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2138], New Brunswick\". And I'm a little afraid that many of you will feel that it is sort of pointless. I'm not sure really but what you'd have to be completely immersed in the atmosphere of New Brunswick to get the real point of it, but. But that said, not implying any superiority on the part of New Brunswickers, unfortunately. Anyway.\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:43:26\nReads \"Ancestral Memories Evoked by Attending the Opening of the Playhouse in Fredericton, New Brunswick\" [from Bread, Wine and Salt].\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:44:36\nReads \"Every Man Owes God a Death\" [from Bread, Wine and Salt].\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:46:41\nThis poem, for no particular reason, is entitled \"The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner\". \n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:46:48\nReads \"The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner\" [from Bread, Wine and Salt].\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:48:23\nThis is a poem that came out of a serious illness that I had last year, and it's entitled \"In the Operating Room\". \n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:48:38\nReads \"In the Operating Room\" [from Bread, Wine and Salt].\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:50:05\nI have a few other recent poems I'll dig out of these. \n \nUnknown\n00:50:12\nAmbient Sound [pause; Nowlan turning pages].\n\nAlden Nowlan\n00:50:47\nAs I sort through these, I'm silently cursing myself for not having done this before I came here. \n \nUnknown\n00:50:52\nAmbient Sound [pause; Nowlan turning pages].\n\nAlden Nowlan\n00:51:20\nHere's a fairly recent poem which isn't a political poem at all, but a human poem. And one that I wrote as a result of watching on television the debates in the United Nations [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1065] on the Middle East [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7204] crisis. And one of the horrible things I felt as I watched it was how completely dehumanized it all was, that the real, human issues had been lost sight of, and sort of drowned in an ocean of resolutions and memos from embassies and all this sort of things. And one night when they televised these sessions through until about four o'clock, the ambassador of Saudi Arabia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q851] spoke, and he delivered certainly a very bigoted speech, and one that as a speech I wouldn't have agreed with, but I felt an admiration for him, because it had seemed to me that he was the only really human thing that had happened there all day. You know, that certainly he was a bigoted old man, full of thousands of years of hatred, but it was a human hatred, expressed in a human manner, something that the rest of them had completely lost sight of. And as a result of this feeling I wrote this poem, \"For Jamil Baroody [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q96384169], Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the United Nations on the Occasion of his Address to the Security Council, June 1967\".\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:53:21\nReads \"For Jamil Baroody, Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the United Nations on the Occasion of his Address to the Security Council, June 1967\".\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:56:26\nReads \"Fireworks\".\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:57:34\nReads \"Two Poems for the Nova Scotia Department of Highways\".\n \nAlden Nowlan\n00:59:31\nFinally, this is a poem entitled \"State Visit\", and the motivation of it, like one of the earlier ones I read, was sort of this same feeling of frustration at the complete dehumanization of politics as we feel it today, and particularly, this sort of apotheosis of world leaders into some sort of a symbol, so they even, I think, begin to think of themselves in these sort of abstract terms, rather than as a human being. And out of--this is sort of, I suppose, perhaps to a degree sort of a bitter little poem, but it stemmed from an emotion which I'm sure many of us feel. \n \nAlden Nowlan\n01:00:27\nReads \"State Visit\".\n \nEND\n01:01:39\n[Cut off abruptly].",

And next week in New York City [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60], Miss Howes will be reading as part of series, or brothers, as part of reading, as part of a reading by fifteen or so other poets, as part of a Poets for Peace, sponsored by the Compassionate Art of the Fellowship of Reconciliation. Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Barbara Howes. \n \nAudience\n00:01:48\nApplause.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:02:17\nThank you very much, Mr. Hoffman, I'm delighted to be here. If you can't hear me, raise your hands or let me know by some other device. Is this a microphone or does this have to do with this machine? Well I'll try to be clear. I thought rather than read a kind of segmented, like a string of sausages, series of poems, going on and on and on, which gives one very little hope that it'll ever end, it'd be better to say that I'm going to have a beginning, a middle, and an end, and that would be...and so I've arranged the poems in this way, so you will have hope that I won't continue forever, which has been done, in the annals of poetry. I wanted to write, read some poems that have to do with place, because I've thought a lot about the effect of place on poems, and to what extent the place you're in influences what you write. One's imagination would never become extended in certain directions if you hadn't happened to live in a certain place. I was very conscious of that when we lived in Florence [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2044] for two years and when my older boy was born, and subsequently for another two years. And I would never--because we--I would never possibly have been able to think, I mean this is obvious in a way, but it gets more complicated, of...Some of the imaginative happenings that occurred would, could never have happened, well in Massachusetts [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q771] or anywhere else, and also even in, I mean in Vermont [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16551], where we now live, have been profoundly affected by the section of the mountain which we life. And also we spent some time in Haiti [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q790], and so on and so forth, so this first group will be mostly poems that have a lot to do with experiences that have happened because of a particular place. The first poem is an Italian poem, or written out of Italy [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q38], called \"Primavera\".\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:04:48\nReads \"Primavera\" [from Light and Dark].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:06:19\nThis is called \"The Triumph of Love\".\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:06:27\nReads \"The Triumph of Love\" [from Light and Dark].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:07:18\nThen for a summer, we lived in a little town in the south of France [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q142], Le Lavandou [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q736462], and it was a very good summer all in all, although, except we had no car and a very big house with only about one room on a floor. So the baby was on the top floor, and the kitchen, it's one burner, was on, you know, it's four floors down. And I would rush up and pick him up and then put him back in his bed, and then rush down and light the burner, and then rush up and get him, and then rush down. So it was difficult in some ways. But one of our entertainments, or entertainments that seemed to certainly entertain friends was to go to an island off Toulon [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q44160] called Ile Levant [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q292516], which is half a naval base and half a colony. And you could go out there in a small--it took about an hour in a small boat, and one time we stood on the dock not quite sure what to do next. Another person who'd come in the boat with us in very high heels and an enormous black hat removed everything else and ran up the hill. [Audience laughter]. So this is \u201cL'Ile du Levant, the Nudist Colony\u201d.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:08:55\nReads \"L'Ile du Levant: the Nudist Colony\" [from Light and Dark].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:10:59\nNow living as I do in the country in Vermont, there comes that terrible time in November when all the hunters from the cities come rushing up with their pint bottles and their confusion and they lounge around half the time sitting in cars and shooting vaguely at anything. So I used to try to write an anti-hunter poem every fall,I don't know about this year, I haven't got an idea yet, but I may see if I can do something. \"In Autumn\". Excuse me. \n \nBarbara Howes\n00:11:37\nReads \"In Autumn\" [from Light and Dark].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:12:29\nAnd this is another on the same subject.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:12:39\nReads [\"Landscape, Deer Season\" from Looking Up At Leaves].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:13:16\nThis is another Pownal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1940266] poem, it's really two things put together. It's called \"A Night Picture of Pownal\u201d, for JFK. And I stood one evening in very bright moonlight looking out at the shadow of the apple tree across the road on the snow and it made an impression on me, I began to take notes in the dark as best I could on it. And then later, shortly after that, for the death of Kennedy [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q9696], then I saw the poem wasn't, it was inadequate, and I somehow put, wove those two things together.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:14:06\nReads \"A Night Picture of Pownal\" [from Looking Up At Leaves].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:15:19\nAnother Vermont poem or Pownal poem on a more cheerful note. \"Town Meeting Tuesday\". Town meeting is the first Tuesday in March, and many of the people who have stayed in all winter then emerge like woodchucks from their houses.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:15:45\nReads \"Town Meeting Tuesday\" [from Looking Up At Leaves].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:16:22\nNow, we spent two or three Easter vacations in the islands of the Caribbean [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q664609], we went to Guadeloupe [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q17012] once for two weeks. And most of the time I find I write fish poems when I go down to the islands but this one is about a dead toucan in Guadeloupe. There was a little, well, a strange little zoo at the small hotel where we stayed and we would look at these creatures and one day I went and there was the toucan and it had fallen over dead. Somehow, it made an impression on me. \"Dead Toucan: Guadeloupe\".\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:17:04\nReads \"Dead Toucan: Guadeloupe\" [from Looking Up At Leaves].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:17:55\nI hope you can hear--can you hear me? In the back rows? We also spent some time in Haiti, earlier, and I'd like to read a couple of poems from that period. This was a thing--it could perfectly well have happened elsewhere but it was the kind of thing that, after we lived in Haiti for a while, I could see very clearly, would definitely have to happen there. There was a young man of about nineteen, very talented as a painter, and did, had just tried out through the art centre there, and doing really quite good and interesting work. And he needed a job so he could buy paints and paper, and anyway just to exist. So an American woman had two small boys and he said he could look after them and play ball and, you know, keep them out of trouble and so on and so forth. And she said, \u201cCan you swim?\u201d And he said, \u201cOh yes, of course.\u201d So the boys dove into the pool because they had been swimming, as most American boys do, for years. And he dove into the pool, and didn't come up. And nobody was around except some workers who were fixing the garden. But like everybody, almost, in Haiti, they didn't want to get involved, because then the police might ask them questions, and then at the end there's trouble, so the poor young man just died, because the little boys couldn't do anything, and nobody else did anything. And so that made an impression on me. But it's the kind of unfortunate tragedy, due to his saying that he could swim and he couldn't, just because he was so desperately anxious to get the job, and he just made himself believe he could swim. Just a complete waste. \n \nBarbara Howes\n00:20:10\nReads [\"In a Prospect of Flowers\" from Light and Dark].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:21:10\n\"Mirror Image: Port-au-Prince [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q34261]\". This, there was a little sign on a tree we used to pass every day and then I thought of this poem.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:21:19\nReads \"Mirror Image: Port-au-Prince\" [from Light and Dark].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:21:59\nThere's one other. Oh yes. \n \nBarbara Howes\n00:22:06\nReads [\"On a Bougainvillea Vine at the Summer Palace\" from Light and Dark]. \n \nBarbara Howes\n00:23:36\nWell, this is one of the fishing poems from the, from Barbados [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q244], from the islands.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:23:46\nReads [\"Out Fishing\" from Looking Up At Leaves].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:24:58\nThis poem is written in one foot, it's just an experiment to see what would happen. I, you know, diameter's two feet, or is it, trimeter is three feet. And tetrameter is four, and pentameter is five. One foot means you just have one sound, like that, and it's just, was a technical experiment, but I might as well read it. And it's also another fish poem. \n \nBarbara Howes\n00:25:32\nReads [\"The Crane Chub--Barbados\" from Looking Up At Leaves].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:26:18\nHere's a fish, well, a jellyfish poem, from Texas [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1439]. \n \nBarbara Howes\n00:26:32\nReads [\"On Galveston Beach\" from Looking Up At Leaves].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:27:32\nAnd then there's the last Caribbean poem, \u201cA Letter from the Caribbean\u201d. \n \nBarbara Howes\n00:27:45\nReads \u201cA Letter From The Caribbean\u201d [from Looking Up At Leaves].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:28:59\nI've thought I would read just a few poems by modern poets that I like, they're not by any means their strongest or anything, but they're just ones I'm attached to. The first I cut out of the paper once, a long time ago. It's by an African schoolgirl, and I think it's very imaginative. It's awkward but it's really quite wonderful.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:29:38\nReads unnamed poem by an unknown author. \n\nBarbara Howes\n00:29:53\nThis is an early poem of Wystan Auden's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q178698] that he kept out of, he didn't use in his book and then he printed again in a recent edition. I think it's technically as awfully, it's light verse but it's also very serious underneath, as good light verse can me. Poem. \n \nBarbara Howes\n00:30:15\nReads [\"To You Simply\"] by W.H. Auden [published in The Collected Poetry of W.H. Auden].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:30:57\nAnd this is a, I think a simply charming poem by Richard Wilbur [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1333582]. It gets...it's about the Piazza di Spagna [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q15124814], the Spanish Steps in Rome [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q220], and it gets the feeling of someone gliding, really gliding down that long, gorgeous stairway. \n \nBarbara Howes\n00:31:22\nReads [\"Piazza Di Spagna, Early Morning\"] by Richard Wilbur.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:32:11\nThis is a poem by Louise Bogan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q516180], who's a very well known American poet, a very recent one that she, that came out in The New Yorker [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q217305], this summer, I think.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:32:27\nReads [\"Masked Woman\u2019s Song\"] by Louise Bogan.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:32:51\nIt's a difficult poem, might read that again, if you don't mind. \n \nBarbara Howes\n00:32:56\nRe \"Masked Woman\u2019s Song\" by Louise Bogan.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:33:17\nAnd then, the last, oh, oh that's right, I thought I would read a poem by Derek Walcott [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q132701], which I used in this Carribean Anthology. It's mostly short stories but I put a poem in front of each language section. This is by Derek Walcott who's a young poet from St. Lucia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q760], called \"Missing the Sea\".\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:33:48\nReads \"Missing the Sea\" by Derek Walcott [from The Castaway and collected in From the Green Antilles: Writings of the Caribbean].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:34:31\nIt's quite a difficult poem but you...he had a book out, oh, can't remember the name, by Farrar, Straus & Giroux [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3067003] a couple of years ago, in the United States. [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30] And the last of this group is a poem that I've heard about a hundred thousand times, but it still gives me a chill. It's called \"American Primitive\" by William Jay Smith [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4355736].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:35:06\nReads \"American Primitive\" by William Jay Smith.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:35:47\nI still get a chill! Now, I don't know whether you prefer to have an intermission, and get up and smoke, or prefer for me to continue, what would you think, Stanton?\n \nUnknown\n00:36:06\nAmbient Sound [voices].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:36:08\nHave an intermission? So people can...breathe?\n \nUnknown\n00:36:17\nAmbient Sound [voices].\n\nUnknown\n00:36:23\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:36:23\nThe problem is the third group of poems, I'd read some poems that are more or less to and about people, and some new poems, although I've noticed that most of my new poems are very depressing, and this is not a good note on which to end, so I'll maybe not read them. I've been very much interested in old French forms, the trielle, the villanelle, the rondeau and rondelle, and ballade and so on and so forth, and they're very difficult but they're fascinating to try, at least. And this is in the form of a trielle. And the lines have to be repeated in a certain fashion which gives you very little room in which to maneuver. This is called \"Early Supper\".\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:37:14\nReads \"Early Supper\" [from Light and Dark].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:38:10\nThis is a poem I wrote for W.H. Auden for his fiftieth birthday, which was several years ago, now. I think actually, he was last year, sixty.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:38:21\nReads [\"To W.H. Auden on his Fiftieth Birthday\" from Light and Dark].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:39:22\nI wrote three poems at that point about winds, and I'll just read one of them. The winds have names in Italy and they almost become like familiar characters. The sirocco, when it blows, is so terrible in its effect on people that if there're crimes of passion, the people generally get off with a lighter sentence, because you sell, well, the sirocco. Naturally you can throttle your wife during that period. This is about the mistral, which, if it blows for three days, one survives, if it blows for six days it's simply awful. If it blows for nine days you've probably already gone out of your head. It's a very wild wind who rushes down the Rhone Valley [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2747791] and just blows everything away. \n \nBarbara Howes\n00:40:22\nReads [\"Mistral\" from Light and Dark].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:41:23\nThis is another one, an old French form, the rondeau, which again makes its, has its own complications because of the repetition of lines. And what interested me to do was to try to use, not the usual subject of the rondeaux but to write about, as in this case, the death of a Vermont farm woman, instead of just doing some sort of chittery-chattery business that generally is what people use a rondeau for. \n \nBarbara Howes\n00:42:03\nReads [\"Death of a Vermont Farm Woman\" from Light and Dark].  \n\nBarbara Howes\n00:42:51\nThis is a poem about a very disagreeable character, a thirteenth-century tyrant called Ugolino [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q706003], who met his death from being thrown into prison to die of hunger. He is reputed to have attempted to eat his sons, who were there with him. I must say, it's not an agreeable picture, but I don't think there's been much improvement in that part of mankind. Dante [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1067] writes of him in the 33rd Canto of the Inferno [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4509219]. This poem is called \"The Critic\" and, I must say, critics have disliked it heartily. \n \nBarbara Howes\n00:43:28\nReads \"The Critic\" [from Light and Dark].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:44:23\nThis is a, an odd combination about a person and about Pownal, I guess. \n \nBarbara Howes\n00:44:32\nReads [\"Running into Edgar Bellemare\" from Looking Up at Leaves]. \n \nBarbara Howes\n00:45:27\nThis is a poem I wrote for Katherine Anne Porter [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q236958] on the occasion of her 75th birthday. \"For Katherine Anne Porter\".\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:45:39\nReads \u201cFor Katherine Anne Porter\u201d [from Looking Up at Leaves].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:46:15\nIt's quite marvelous, those collective nouns, who would know that you call a lot of heron a siege of herons and so forth. I'll read that again, because it really is, I was very lucky the way it worked out.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:46:31\nReads line from \u201cFor Katherine Anne Porter\u201d.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:47:06\nThis is called \"Looking up at Leaves\".\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:47:14\nReads \"Looking up at Leaves\" [from Looking Up At Leaves].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:48:09\nI'd like to read one New England [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q18389] poem, this is a newer poem, I haven't read this before, I guess.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:48:16\nReads [\"Still Life: New England\", published later in The Blue Garden].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:49:34\nI'll read three more poems, I think. This is \"A Rune for C.\"--\u2018C.\u2019 was a dog of ours. \n \nBarbara Howes\n00:49:51\nReads \"A Rune for C.\" [from Looking Up At Leaves].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:50:36\nActually, I had just often, I'd made up a good luck thing that seeing the caboose was good luck, but then I found out that this has been an old piece of, well, I don't know, country folklore, that to see the caboose, it means luck. I want to read one poem about my son, and then one short one. \"Portrait of the Boy as Artist\".\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:51:18\nReads \"Portrait of the Boy as Artist\" [from Light and Dark].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:52:11\nOh, I did want to read one that I'll read next week in New York. This poem is a, this is a rondelle, which is another old French form. And I'm obviously not using it for the usual subject, in this case. It's arranged about the idea, really, of a contrast of the use of space. \"Viet-Napalm: A Rondelle\".\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:52:45\nReads \"Viet-Napalm: A Rondelle\".\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:53:31\nAnd then one last poem on a more cheerful note. \"Leaning into Light\".\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:53:44\nReads \"Leaning into Light\" [from Looking Up At Leaves].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:54:21.\nThank you very much. \n \nAudience\n00:54:23\nApplause.\n \nStanton Hoffman\n00:54:38\nOne announcement, the next reading will be by Charles Reznikoff [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1065911], and that's Friday, the same time, November 17th. \n\nUnknown\n00:54:46\nAmbient Sound [voices].\n \nEND\n00:54:57\n"

She enrolled at Bennington College in Vermont before moving to New York City upon her graduation. Howes then worked as an editor of Chimera: A Literary Magazine between 1944 and 1947. She married poet William Jay Smith, and they lived in England and Italy for a short while. Her first collection of poetry was published in 1948, named The Undersea Farmer (Banyan Press), which was followed by In the Cold Country (Bonaci & Saul in association with Grove Press, 1954), both of which drew critical acclaim and praise. She then published Light and Dark (Wesleyan University Press, 1959), Looking Up at Leaves (Knopf, 1966), The Blue Garden (Wesleyan University Press, 1972) and A Private Signal: Poems New and Selected (Wesleyan University Press, 1977). Howes divorced in the 60\u2019s and traveled to the Caribbean, which inspired her to edit two anthologies of Caribbean and Latin American writing: From the Green Antilles: Writings of the Caribbean (Macmillan, 1966) and The Eye of the Heart: Short Stories from Latin America (Bobbs-Merrill, 1973). Howes also edited 23 Modern Stories, (Vintage, 1963), The Sea-Green Horse with her son Gregory Jay Smith (Macmillan, 1970), The Road Commissioner and Other Stories (Stinehour Press, 1983). She published two final collections of poetry, Moving (Elysian Press, 1983) and The Collected Poems of Barbara Howes, 1945-1990 (University of Arkansas Press, 1995), which was nominated for the 1995 National Book Award. Her poetry can be found in dozens of periodicals and literary magazines. Barbara Howes died at the age of 81 in Pownal, Vermont in 1996."

And next week in New York City [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60], Miss Howes will be reading as part of series, or brothers, as part of reading, as part of a reading by fifteen or so other poets, as part of a Poets for Peace, sponsored by the Compassionate Art of the Fellowship of Reconciliation. Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Barbara Howes. \n \nAudience\n00:01:48\nApplause.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:02:17\nThank you very much, Mr. Hoffman, I'm delighted to be here. If you can't hear me, raise your hands or let me know by some other device. Is this a microphone or does this have to do with this machine? Well I'll try to be clear. I thought rather than read a kind of segmented, like a string of sausages, series of poems, going on and on and on, which gives one very little hope that it'll ever end, it'd be better to say that I'm going to have a beginning, a middle, and an end, and that would be...and so I've arranged the poems in this way, so you will have hope that I won't continue forever, which has been done, in the annals of poetry. I wanted to write, read some poems that have to do with place, because I've thought a lot about the effect of place on poems, and to what extent the place you're in influences what you write. One's imagination would never become extended in certain directions if you hadn't happened to live in a certain place. I was very conscious of that when we lived in Florence [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2044] for two years and when my older boy was born, and subsequently for another two years. And I would never--because we--I would never possibly have been able to think, I mean this is obvious in a way, but it gets more complicated, of...Some of the imaginative happenings that occurred would, could never have happened, well in Massachusetts [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q771] or anywhere else, and also even in, I mean in Vermont [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16551], where we now live, have been profoundly affected by the section of the mountain which we life. And also we spent some time in Haiti [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q790], and so on and so forth, so this first group will be mostly poems that have a lot to do with experiences that have happened because of a particular place. The first poem is an Italian poem, or written out of Italy [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q38], called \"Primavera\".\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:04:48\nReads \"Primavera\" [from Light and Dark].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:06:19\nThis is called \"The Triumph of Love\".\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:06:27\nReads \"The Triumph of Love\" [from Light and Dark].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:07:18\nThen for a summer, we lived in a little town in the south of France [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q142], Le Lavandou [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q736462], and it was a very good summer all in all, although, except we had no car and a very big house with only about one room on a floor. So the baby was on the top floor, and the kitchen, it's one burner, was on, you know, it's four floors down. And I would rush up and pick him up and then put him back in his bed, and then rush down and light the burner, and then rush up and get him, and then rush down. So it was difficult in some ways. But one of our entertainments, or entertainments that seemed to certainly entertain friends was to go to an island off Toulon [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q44160] called Ile Levant [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q292516], which is half a naval base and half a colony. And you could go out there in a small--it took about an hour in a small boat, and one time we stood on the dock not quite sure what to do next. Another person who'd come in the boat with us in very high heels and an enormous black hat removed everything else and ran up the hill. [Audience laughter]. So this is \u201cL'Ile du Levant, the Nudist Colony\u201d.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:08:55\nReads \"L'Ile du Levant: the Nudist Colony\" [from Light and Dark].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:10:59\nNow living as I do in the country in Vermont, there comes that terrible time in November when all the hunters from the cities come rushing up with their pint bottles and their confusion and they lounge around half the time sitting in cars and shooting vaguely at anything. So I used to try to write an anti-hunter poem every fall,I don't know about this year, I haven't got an idea yet, but I may see if I can do something. \"In Autumn\". Excuse me. \n \nBarbara Howes\n00:11:37\nReads \"In Autumn\" [from Light and Dark].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:12:29\nAnd this is another on the same subject.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:12:39\nReads [\"Landscape, Deer Season\" from Looking Up At Leaves].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:13:16\nThis is another Pownal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1940266] poem, it's really two things put together. It's called \"A Night Picture of Pownal\u201d, for JFK. And I stood one evening in very bright moonlight looking out at the shadow of the apple tree across the road on the snow and it made an impression on me, I began to take notes in the dark as best I could on it. And then later, shortly after that, for the death of Kennedy [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q9696], then I saw the poem wasn't, it was inadequate, and I somehow put, wove those two things together.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:14:06\nReads \"A Night Picture of Pownal\" [from Looking Up At Leaves].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:15:19\nAnother Vermont poem or Pownal poem on a more cheerful note. \"Town Meeting Tuesday\". Town meeting is the first Tuesday in March, and many of the people who have stayed in all winter then emerge like woodchucks from their houses.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:15:45\nReads \"Town Meeting Tuesday\" [from Looking Up At Leaves].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:16:22\nNow, we spent two or three Easter vacations in the islands of the Caribbean [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q664609], we went to Guadeloupe [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q17012] once for two weeks. And most of the time I find I write fish poems when I go down to the islands but this one is about a dead toucan in Guadeloupe. There was a little, well, a strange little zoo at the small hotel where we stayed and we would look at these creatures and one day I went and there was the toucan and it had fallen over dead. Somehow, it made an impression on me. \"Dead Toucan: Guadeloupe\".\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:17:04\nReads \"Dead Toucan: Guadeloupe\" [from Looking Up At Leaves].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:17:55\nI hope you can hear--can you hear me? In the back rows? We also spent some time in Haiti, earlier, and I'd like to read a couple of poems from that period. This was a thing--it could perfectly well have happened elsewhere but it was the kind of thing that, after we lived in Haiti for a while, I could see very clearly, would definitely have to happen there. There was a young man of about nineteen, very talented as a painter, and did, had just tried out through the art centre there, and doing really quite good and interesting work. And he needed a job so he could buy paints and paper, and anyway just to exist. So an American woman had two small boys and he said he could look after them and play ball and, you know, keep them out of trouble and so on and so forth. And she said, \u201cCan you swim?\u201d And he said, \u201cOh yes, of course.\u201d So the boys dove into the pool because they had been swimming, as most American boys do, for years. And he dove into the pool, and didn't come up. And nobody was around except some workers who were fixing the garden. But like everybody, almost, in Haiti, they didn't want to get involved, because then the police might ask them questions, and then at the end there's trouble, so the poor young man just died, because the little boys couldn't do anything, and nobody else did anything. And so that made an impression on me. But it's the kind of unfortunate tragedy, due to his saying that he could swim and he couldn't, just because he was so desperately anxious to get the job, and he just made himself believe he could swim. Just a complete waste. \n \nBarbara Howes\n00:20:10\nReads [\"In a Prospect of Flowers\" from Light and Dark].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:21:10\n\"Mirror Image: Port-au-Prince [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q34261]\". This, there was a little sign on a tree we used to pass every day and then I thought of this poem.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:21:19\nReads \"Mirror Image: Port-au-Prince\" [from Light and Dark].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:21:59\nThere's one other. Oh yes. \n \nBarbara Howes\n00:22:06\nReads [\"On a Bougainvillea Vine at the Summer Palace\" from Light and Dark]. \n \nBarbara Howes\n00:23:36\nWell, this is one of the fishing poems from the, from Barbados [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q244], from the islands.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:23:46\nReads [\"Out Fishing\" from Looking Up At Leaves].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:24:58\nThis poem is written in one foot, it's just an experiment to see what would happen. I, you know, diameter's two feet, or is it, trimeter is three feet. And tetrameter is four, and pentameter is five. One foot means you just have one sound, like that, and it's just, was a technical experiment, but I might as well read it. And it's also another fish poem. \n \nBarbara Howes\n00:25:32\nReads [\"The Crane Chub--Barbados\" from Looking Up At Leaves].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:26:18\nHere's a fish, well, a jellyfish poem, from Texas [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1439]. \n \nBarbara Howes\n00:26:32\nReads [\"On Galveston Beach\" from Looking Up At Leaves].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:27:32\nAnd then there's the last Caribbean poem, \u201cA Letter from the Caribbean\u201d. \n \nBarbara Howes\n00:27:45\nReads \u201cA Letter From The Caribbean\u201d [from Looking Up At Leaves].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:28:59\nI've thought I would read just a few poems by modern poets that I like, they're not by any means their strongest or anything, but they're just ones I'm attached to. The first I cut out of the paper once, a long time ago. It's by an African schoolgirl, and I think it's very imaginative. It's awkward but it's really quite wonderful.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:29:38\nReads unnamed poem by an unknown author. \n\nBarbara Howes\n00:29:53\nThis is an early poem of Wystan Auden's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q178698] that he kept out of, he didn't use in his book and then he printed again in a recent edition. I think it's technically as awfully, it's light verse but it's also very serious underneath, as good light verse can me. Poem. \n \nBarbara Howes\n00:30:15\nReads [\"To You Simply\"] by W.H. Auden [published in The Collected Poetry of W.H. Auden].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:30:57\nAnd this is a, I think a simply charming poem by Richard Wilbur [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1333582]. It gets...it's about the Piazza di Spagna [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q15124814], the Spanish Steps in Rome [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q220], and it gets the feeling of someone gliding, really gliding down that long, gorgeous stairway. \n \nBarbara Howes\n00:31:22\nReads [\"Piazza Di Spagna, Early Morning\"] by Richard Wilbur.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:32:11\nThis is a poem by Louise Bogan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q516180], who's a very well known American poet, a very recent one that she, that came out in The New Yorker [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q217305], this summer, I think.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:32:27\nReads [\"Masked Woman\u2019s Song\"] by Louise Bogan.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:32:51\nIt's a difficult poem, might read that again, if you don't mind. \n \nBarbara Howes\n00:32:56\nRe \"Masked Woman\u2019s Song\" by Louise Bogan.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:33:17\nAnd then, the last, oh, oh that's right, I thought I would read a poem by Derek Walcott [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q132701], which I used in this Carribean Anthology. It's mostly short stories but I put a poem in front of each language section. This is by Derek Walcott who's a young poet from St. Lucia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q760], called \"Missing the Sea\".\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:33:48\nReads \"Missing the Sea\" by Derek Walcott [from The Castaway and collected in From the Green Antilles: Writings of the Caribbean].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:34:31\nIt's quite a difficult poem but you...he had a book out, oh, can't remember the name, by Farrar, Straus & Giroux [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3067003] a couple of years ago, in the United States. [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30] And the last of this group is a poem that I've heard about a hundred thousand times, but it still gives me a chill. It's called \"American Primitive\" by William Jay Smith [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4355736].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:35:06\nReads \"American Primitive\" by William Jay Smith.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:35:47\nI still get a chill! Now, I don't know whether you prefer to have an intermission, and get up and smoke, or prefer for me to continue, what would you think, Stanton?\n \nUnknown\n00:36:06\nAmbient Sound [voices].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:36:08\nHave an intermission? So people can...breathe?\n \nUnknown\n00:36:17\nAmbient Sound [voices].\n\nUnknown\n00:36:23\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:36:23\nThe problem is the third group of poems, I'd read some poems that are more or less to and about people, and some new poems, although I've noticed that most of my new poems are very depressing, and this is not a good note on which to end, so I'll maybe not read them. I've been very much interested in old French forms, the trielle, the villanelle, the rondeau and rondelle, and ballade and so on and so forth, and they're very difficult but they're fascinating to try, at least. And this is in the form of a trielle. And the lines have to be repeated in a certain fashion which gives you very little room in which to maneuver. This is called \"Early Supper\".\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:37:14\nReads \"Early Supper\" [from Light and Dark].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:38:10\nThis is a poem I wrote for W.H. Auden for his fiftieth birthday, which was several years ago, now. I think actually, he was last year, sixty.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:38:21\nReads [\"To W.H. Auden on his Fiftieth Birthday\" from Light and Dark].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:39:22\nI wrote three poems at that point about winds, and I'll just read one of them. The winds have names in Italy and they almost become like familiar characters. The sirocco, when it blows, is so terrible in its effect on people that if there're crimes of passion, the people generally get off with a lighter sentence, because you sell, well, the sirocco. Naturally you can throttle your wife during that period. This is about the mistral, which, if it blows for three days, one survives, if it blows for six days it's simply awful. If it blows for nine days you've probably already gone out of your head. It's a very wild wind who rushes down the Rhone Valley [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2747791] and just blows everything away. \n \nBarbara Howes\n00:40:22\nReads [\"Mistral\" from Light and Dark].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:41:23\nThis is another one, an old French form, the rondeau, which again makes its, has its own complications because of the repetition of lines. And what interested me to do was to try to use, not the usual subject of the rondeaux but to write about, as in this case, the death of a Vermont farm woman, instead of just doing some sort of chittery-chattery business that generally is what people use a rondeau for. \n \nBarbara Howes\n00:42:03\nReads [\"Death of a Vermont Farm Woman\" from Light and Dark].  \n\nBarbara Howes\n00:42:51\nThis is a poem about a very disagreeable character, a thirteenth-century tyrant called Ugolino [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q706003], who met his death from being thrown into prison to die of hunger. He is reputed to have attempted to eat his sons, who were there with him. I must say, it's not an agreeable picture, but I don't think there's been much improvement in that part of mankind. Dante [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1067] writes of him in the 33rd Canto of the Inferno [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4509219]. This poem is called \"The Critic\" and, I must say, critics have disliked it heartily. \n \nBarbara Howes\n00:43:28\nReads \"The Critic\" [from Light and Dark].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:44:23\nThis is a, an odd combination about a person and about Pownal, I guess. \n \nBarbara Howes\n00:44:32\nReads [\"Running into Edgar Bellemare\" from Looking Up at Leaves]. \n \nBarbara Howes\n00:45:27\nThis is a poem I wrote for Katherine Anne Porter [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q236958] on the occasion of her 75th birthday. \"For Katherine Anne Porter\".\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:45:39\nReads \u201cFor Katherine Anne Porter\u201d [from Looking Up at Leaves].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:46:15\nIt's quite marvelous, those collective nouns, who would know that you call a lot of heron a siege of herons and so forth. I'll read that again, because it really is, I was very lucky the way it worked out.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:46:31\nReads line from \u201cFor Katherine Anne Porter\u201d.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:47:06\nThis is called \"Looking up at Leaves\".\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:47:14\nReads \"Looking up at Leaves\" [from Looking Up At Leaves].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:48:09\nI'd like to read one New England [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q18389] poem, this is a newer poem, I haven't read this before, I guess.\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:48:16\nReads [\"Still Life: New England\", published later in The Blue Garden].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:49:34\nI'll read three more poems, I think. This is \"A Rune for C.\"--\u2018C.\u2019 was a dog of ours. \n \nBarbara Howes\n00:49:51\nReads \"A Rune for C.\" [from Looking Up At Leaves].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:50:36\nActually, I had just often, I'd made up a good luck thing that seeing the caboose was good luck, but then I found out that this has been an old piece of, well, I don't know, country folklore, that to see the caboose, it means luck. I want to read one poem about my son, and then one short one. \"Portrait of the Boy as Artist\".\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:51:18\nReads \"Portrait of the Boy as Artist\" [from Light and Dark].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:52:11\nOh, I did want to read one that I'll read next week in New York. This poem is a, this is a rondelle, which is another old French form. And I'm obviously not using it for the usual subject, in this case. It's arranged about the idea, really, of a contrast of the use of space. \"Viet-Napalm: A Rondelle\".\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:52:45\nReads \"Viet-Napalm: A Rondelle\".\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:53:31\nAnd then one last poem on a more cheerful note. \"Leaning into Light\".\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:53:44\nReads \"Leaning into Light\" [from Looking Up At Leaves].\n \nBarbara Howes\n00:54:21.\nThank you very much. \n \nAudience\n00:54:23\nApplause.\n \nStanton Hoffman\n00:54:38\nOne announcement, the next reading will be by Charles Reznikoff [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1065911], and that's Friday, the same time, November 17th. \n\nUnknown\n00:54:46\nAmbient Sound [voices].\n \nEND\n00:54:57\n",

            "contents": "charles_reznikoff_i006-11-153.mp3\n\nGeorge Bowering\n00:00:00\nI'd like to welcome you all to our third reading, and announce just before I have to say what I say that the next reading will be with Daryl Hine [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5226186] on the first of December. Tonight's reading will be by, as you probably all know, Mr. Charles Reznikoff [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1065911], whom I'm very happy to have the job, the chore of introducing, because I've been interested in his work for many years. He was born in Brooklyn [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q18419], 1894, and graduated from the law school of New York University [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q49210], admitted to the bar of the state of New York [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60] but never practiced, however, the law experience has stood him in good stead for his later poetry. He's published a number of volumes of verse and several volumes of prose, but most to the point, books that you probably saw on the table outside, in print by New Directions [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q27474] and the San Francisco Review [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q17087510], By the Waters of Manhattan, which was this joint effort's first book in 1962, and in 1965, Testimony, which is the first volume in a projected series of volumes about the moral and legal history of the United States [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30]. The main--my--the reason I said that I'm very happy about Mr. Reznikoff is because when I was going to university I was very hard looking for an alternative to the kind of poetry that was in vogue, especially in the universities, that is, that which tended towards T.S. Eliot [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q37767] and highly symbolic language, and Mr. Reznikoff was one of the first poets I found able to do that for me, and I found a short poem of his which I would like to be brash enough to read, as introduction. He said, \"Not because of victories I sing, having none, but for the common sunshine, the breeze, the largesse of spring. Not for victory, but for the day's work done, as well as I was able, not for a seat upon the dais, but at the common table.\"  So to this common table, rather than dais, I'd like to welcome Mr. Charles Reznikoff.  \n \nAudience\n00:02:34\nApplause.\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:02:56\nVery much obliged to the gentleman who introduced me, among other things, for reading something I did. Perhaps I should ask him to read all that I brought along. But to get down to what I have here, let me say, to begin with, a few days ago, I came across in a bookshop a collection of Chinese verse translated into English. At the beginning was the following, written a thousand years ago, and I was very much impressed with it, and permit me to read it to you as a sort of an introduction. This man who wrote in the 11th century, this Chinese, said this: \"Poetry presents the thing in order to convey the feeling.  It should be precise about the thing and reticent about the feeling.\" I thought that was...expressed exactly what I feel, and what I have tried to do, not always, not always, I'm afraid, as well as called for, but a recipe. Among other things, let me begin by reading a couple of things I did also on the way I think verse should be written. And this is from this, By the Waters of Manhattan. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:04:47\nReads \"Salmon and Red Wine\" from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse [also published in Inscriptions: 1944-1956].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:05:39\nThat's the first in this. And the second, I did on the same theme, in a way. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:05:47\nReads \"I have neither the time nor the weaving skill, perhaps\" from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse [also published in Inscriptions: 1944-1956].\n\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:06:13\nNow, let me start with a group which I've written about the city I come from, New York, and its suburbs, and some of its residents, including myself.\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:06:27\nReads \"The winter afternoon darkens\" [from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:06:44\nAnd this I call \"The Scrubwoman\". \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:06:48\nReads \"The Scrubwoman\" [from Rhythms II and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:07:07\nReads \"The peddler who goes from shop to shop\". \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:07:27\nAnd this next. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:07:31\nReads \u201cThe elevator man\" [from Going To and Fro and Walking Up and Down and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse]. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:07:54\nReads \"The shopgirls leave their work\" [from Five Groups of Verse, Rhythms, and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:08:16\nThis one I call \"Cooper Union Library\". I should add, it's no longer that way, this is the way it used to be.\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:08:23\nReads \"Cooper Union Library\" [from \"Going To and Fro and Walking Up and Down and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:08:42\nReads \"Showing a Torn Sleeve\" [from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse and published later in Poems 1918-1936: The Complete Poems of Charles Reznikoff]. \n\nCharles Reznikoff\n00:09:06\nReads \"Two girls of twelve or so at a table\" [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956 and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:09:54\nReads \"I am always surprised to meet\" [from Going To and Fro and Walking Up and Down and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:10:23\nReads \"Rails in the Subway\" [from Jerusalem the Golden and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse]. \n \nAudience\n00:10:35\nLaughter.\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:10:41\nReads \"This subway station, with its electric lights\" [from Going To and Fro and Walking Up and Down and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nAudience\n00:10:58\nLaughter.\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:11:06\nReads \"Among the heaps of brick and plaster lies\" [from Jerusalem the Golden and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:11:18\nReads \"The sky is blue\" [from Jerusalem is Golden].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:11:42\nThis I call \"Suburban River, Winter\".\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:11:48\nReads \"Suburban River, Winter\" [from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:12:07\nAnd this too I call \"Suburban River,\" this is \"Summer\".\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:12:13\nReads \"Suburban River, Summer\" [from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:12:38\nThis I call \"Twilight\".\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:12:40\nReads \"Twilight\" [from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse and published later in The Poems Of Charles Reznikoff 1918\u20131975]. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:12:56\nReads \"Fraser, I think, tells of a Roman\" [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956 and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse; audience laughter throughout].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:13:21\nReads \"The dogs that walk with me\u201d [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956 and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:13:44\nThis I call a \"Fable\".\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:13:46\nReads \"Fable\" [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956 and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse]. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:14:15\nReads \"Scrap of paper\" [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956 and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].  \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:14:28\nReads \"One of my sentinels, a tree\" [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956 and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].   \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:14:45\nReads \"I have not even been in the fields\" [from Rhythms ll and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse]. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:15:01\nReads \"How grey you are! No, white!\u201d [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956 and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse]. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:15:25\nReads \"Blurred sight, and trembling fingers\" [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956 and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse]. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:15:47\nReads \"You were young and contemptuous\" [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956 and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse]. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:16:03\nThis I call \"Heart and Clock\", there's a series in here. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:16:09\nReads \"Heart and Clock\u201d [from Separate Way and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:16:51\nReads \"If my days were like the ant's\" [published as \u201cHeart and Clock II\u201d in By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse]. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:17:18\nReads \"Our nightingale, the clock\" [from Jerusalem the Golden and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].  \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:17:32\nReads \"The clock on the bookcase ticks\" [from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse and published later in The Poems Of Charles Reznikoff 1918\u20131975].  \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:17:47\nReads \"My hair was caught in the wheels of a clock\" [from Jerusalem the Golden and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].   \n\nCharles Reznikoff\n00:17:58\nReads \"Of course we must die\" [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956 and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:18:20\nReads \"Now it is cold\" [from Going To and Fro and Walking Up and Down and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n\nCharles Reznikoff\n00:19:33\nReads \"It had been snowing at night\" [from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse and published later in The Poems Of Charles Reznikoff 1918\u20131975].  \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:19:54\nReads \"Hardly a breath of wind\" [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956 and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:20:14\nReads \"After I had worked all day\" [from Five Groups of Verse and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse]. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:20:42\nNow I have a group that I will call 'religious,' for perhaps no better word, and this I call \"Meditations on the Fall and Winter Holidays\", and the first is \u201cNew Year's\u201d. As many of you, or some of you may know, no doubt, the Jewish New Year's comes in the fall. This is based on it.\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:21:11\nReads \"Meditations on the Fall and Winter Holidays: New Year's\" [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956 and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:23:19\nAnd I call the next one \"The Day of Atonement\".\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:23:24\nReads \"The Day of Atonement\" [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956 and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:24:50\nAnd this I call \"Hanukkah\" which incidentally is a holiday that's just about to come, and it, as some of you may know, it represents the victory, a festival celebrating the victory of the Maccabees over the Syrians, about 150 B.C.E.\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:25:14\nReads \"Hanukkah\" [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956 and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:26:59\nI don't know why I should be having a cold on this occasion but, [laughter], these things [blows nose]. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:27:18\nReads \"The lamps are burning in the synagogue\" [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:28:40\nThis one I call \"Samuel\". Samuel in the Bible, of course.\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:28:47\nReads \"Samuel\" [from Five Groups of Verse and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:30:06\nThese are all from By the Waters of Manhattan, and I'm going to read you, if I may, something quite different, from the volume called Testimony, and which I call \"Recitative\".\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:30:27\nReads \"Recitative\" [from Testimony: the United States (1885-1890); Recitative].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:31:15\nThat's the first. This, these, incidentally, I might say, are all based on law cases. Ah...I don't know what...whether that'll excuse their ferocity, but apparently something like that once happened. The names are different. The facts are the same.\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:31:39\nReads \"Tilda was just a child...\u201d [from Testimony: the United States (1885-1890); Recitative].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:32:49\nAnd this is the third in this. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:32:53\nReads \"Years ago, a company procured a body of land...\" [from Testimony: the United States (1885-1890); Recitative].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:33:44\nNow...let's see, if I may, the time...Here is a poem with which I generally end these readings but I don't intend to end this unless you wish me to because I have some other things to read. But I'll end it right here anyway and then we'll see how much time is left. I call this \"Kaddish\". Now, it's not the Kaddish for mourners that you might know about. It was written at the beginning of the rise of Hitler [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q352]. I did it; I mean, I did the writing, not the Kaddish, which is very old. It was written at the beginning of the rise of Hitler and his influence, and before his extermination program was put into effect. It's really an ancient blessing in the Jewish ritual. And incidentally, I use that word \"Torah,\" and I doubt, it may be strange to many, but James Parks, I notice, in his History of the Jewish People, has defined it, correctly, I think, \"The word Torah,\" he says, \"has been defined as law, but is much wider in meaning. It applies a way of life\".  Now this is this \"Kaddish\".\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:35:09\nReads \"Kaddish\" [from Separate Way and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse]].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:36:43\nThis ends the, let's say the first part. And I'll continue, if you like, with some others, unless you're all...[inaudible]\n \nAudience\n00:36:51\nApplause.\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:37:04\nWell I, if, I shall continue, if you're not all exhausted. I have here, quite a few things that are not arranged in any way, so they're more or less haphazard. And...this is one. Let's see...well this one is \u201cAfter Reading Translations of Ancient Texts on Stone and Clay\u201d.\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:37:37\nReads \u201cAfter Reading Translations of Ancient Texts on Stone and Clay\u201d.\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:38:47\nNow, these, these are much less organized than that, haphazard, you'll have to take them as they come if we keep on. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:39:00\nReads \"As I was wandering with my unhappy thoughts\" [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956 and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n\nCharles Reznikoff\n00:39:36\nReads \"The young fellow walks about with nothing to do\" [from Going To and Fro and Walking Up and Down and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse]. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:40:09\nReads \u201cA well-phrased eulogy\" [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956 and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:40:44\nReads \"On a Sunday, when the place was closed\" [from Going To and Fro and Walking Up and Down].  \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:41:12\nNow here are two earlier testimony, two or more things based on a law case, which I call \"Testimony\", and these were included in that same By the Waters of Manhattan. \n \nBy the Waters of Manhattan. \n00:41:28\nReads \"The Company had advertised for men\" from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:43:13\nThat's the first, and this is the second.\n \nCharles Reznikoff \n00:43:16\nReads \"Amelia was just fourteen\" from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse.\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:44:33\nThat's the second. I have some more I'd like to get at before I close. Well, this I wrote for my wife. Pity she isn't here, but we'll read it in her absence.\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:44:55\nReads \"Malicious women greet you, saying...\" [from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse and published later in The Poems Of Charles Reznikoff 1918\u20131975].  \n\n Charles Reznikoff\n00:45:38\nNow, this, this is a kind of counterpiece to this I have just read. It was not written for my wife. [Laughter].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:45:56\nReads \"He had with him a bag\" [from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse and published later in The Poems Of Charles Reznikoff 1918\u20131975].  \n \nAudience\n00:46:38\nLaughter. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:46:42\nI'm reading this 'cause...\"On a seat\"...maybe it would....I think this is rather appropriate in view of all the Hebrew things I read.\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:46:56\nReads \"On a seat in the subway\" [from Going To and Fro and Walking Up and Down].  \n\nCharles Reznikoff\n00:47:41\nReads \"Permit me to warn you\" [from Jerusalem the Golden and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nAudience\n00:47:51\nLaughter.\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:47:59\nReads \"These days, the papers in the street\" [from Jerusalem the Golden and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:48:36\nLet me close, unless it...if I should...with something that I tried to do which may be something to close with. This is based on the Book of Ezra [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q131635], and the Book of Ezra, according to my note, I've probably forgotten by this time, is, 'This is a rearrangement and a versification of parts of the Fourth Book of Ezra.' And that's what it's called in the appendix to the Vulgate [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q131175], or two Esdras of the Protestant Apocrypha. And I based this upon a translation of this Book of Ezra from the Syriac by a friend of mine who taught, and I have their permission and all, but the original was probably, there's quite a discussion as to what the original was right, and some scholars believe that it was in Greek, and a Doctor Bocks, who was in, G.H. Bocks, thinks that it was in Hebrew, and Bloch, who was, they had in 42nd Street at the library, didn't think that it was in either Greek or Hebrew, but Aramaic. Anyway, excuse me just, [laughter], anyway, I will read it, and its adaptation of it, and see what one can do with things that you...clear up. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:50:12\nReads \u201cBecause I saw the desolation of Zion\" [from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse and published later in The Poems of Charles Reznikoff: 1918-1975]. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:53:33\nAnd I think this is enough, perhaps, for a time. \n \nAudience\n00:53:36\nApplause.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:54:01\nWhat else, thank you very much, Mr. Reznikoff, and I'd just like to repeat that the next reading is at, two weeks from tonight, December the first, Daryl Hine, who's a graduate of the other university.\n \nEND\n00:54:21\n"

                "notes": "American poet Charles Reznikoff was born on August 31, 1894, in Brooklyn, New York. His parents were Jewish Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s, and often encountered anti-semitism, which would have a strong influence on Reznikoff\u2019s later work. An intelligent boy, Reznikoff finished high school in 1909, at the age of fifteen- three years ahead of his class. In the hopes of becoming a writer, Reznikoff entered the journalism department at the University of Missouri, but left after a year when he realized the priorities of a journalist and a poet were different. In 1912, he enrolled in New York University\u2019s Law school, graduating at the top of his class in 1915, and entered the Bar of the State of New York the next year. Reznikoff spent a few years practicing as a lawyer, but again, he felt he needed to spend his energy writing, not working as a lawyer. Reznikoff published his first book of poems Rhythms in 1918, on his own small press, the next year printing Rhythms II. In 1920, he met Samuel Roth, who published Poems (S.Roth at the New York Poetry Book Shop), and during that decade he was able to publish more poems in magazines and plays. Reznikoff supported himself by working on the editorial board of the American Law Book Company, writing law encyclopedias. Reznikoff married his wife, Marie Syrkin in 1930. During the 1930s, Reznikoff met and joined the Objectivist group with Louis Zukofsky, George Oppen and Carl Rakosi. The Objectivist Press published three of Reznikoff\u2019s books, Jerusalem the Golden (Objectivist Press, 1934), In Memoriam: 1933 (Objectivist Press, 1934) and Separate Way (Objectivist Press, 1936). Reznikoff spent a short time in Hollywood in the late 30\u2019s, working as a screenwriter. Marie Reznikoff was hired by the English Department at Brandeis University in Boston, and throughout the 40\u2019s Charles Reznikoff stayed in New York working on freelance contracts. Reznikoff published Going To and Fro and Walking Up and Down (Futuro Press, 1941). For a period of eighteen years, Reznikoff did not publish any poetry, until 1959, when Inscriptions: 1944-1956  was self-published. Reznikoff then published By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse (New Directions, 1962), his major works Testimony: The United States (1885-1890): Recitative (New Directions, 1965), Testimony: The United States (1891-1900): Recitative (Privately Published, 1968) and Holocaust (Black Sparrow Press, 1975). Reznikoff also published By the Well of Living and Seeing and The Fifth Book of the Maccabees (Self Published, 1969), By the Well of Living & Seeing: New & Selected Poems 1918-1973 (Black Sparrow Press, 1974), several works of prose including Testimony (The Objectivist Press, 1934) and Family Chronicle: An Odyssey from Russia to America (Norton Bailey with the Human Constitution, 1969). A lifelong resident of New York City, Charles Reznikoff died on January 22, 1976 after suffering from a heart attack. The most comprehensive collection of Reznikoff\u2019s work can be found in Poems 1918-1975: The Complete Poems of Charles Reznikoff (Black Sparrow Press, 1976-77), edited by Seamus Cooney."

[INDEX: Daryl Hine reading, December 1.]",
                "contents": "George Bowering\n00:00:00\nI'd like to welcome you all to our third reading, and announce just before I have to say what I say that the next reading will be with Daryl Hine [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5226186] on the first of December. Tonight's reading will be by, as you probably all know, Mr. Charles Reznikoff [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1065911], whom I'm very happy to have the job, the chore of introducing, because I've been interested in his work for many years. He was born in Brooklyn [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q18419], 1894, and graduated from the law school of New York University [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q49210], admitted to the bar of the state of New York [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60] but never practiced, however, the law experience has stood him in good stead for his later poetry. He's published a number of volumes of verse and several volumes of prose, but most to the point, books that you probably saw on the table outside, in print by New Directions [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q27474] and the San Francisco Review [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q17087510], By the Waters of Manhattan, which was this joint effort's first book in 1962, and in 1965, Testimony, which is the first volume in a projected series of volumes about the moral and legal history of the United States [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30]. The main--my--the reason I said that I'm very happy about Mr. Reznikoff is because when I was going to university I was very hard looking for an alternative to the kind of poetry that was in vogue, especially in the universities, that is, that which tended towards T.S. Eliot [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q37767] and highly symbolic language, and Mr. Reznikoff was one of the first poets I found able to do that for me, and I found a short poem of his which I would like to be brash enough to read, as introduction. He said, \"Not because of victories I sing, having none, but for the common sunshine, the breeze, the largesse of spring. Not for victory, but for the day's work done, as well as I was able, not for a seat upon the dais, but at the common table.\"  So to this common table, rather than dais, I'd like to welcome Mr. Charles Reznikoff.  \n \nAudience\n00:02:34\nApplause.\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:02:56\nVery much obliged to the gentleman who introduced me, among other things, for reading something I did. Perhaps I should ask him to read all that I brought along. But to get down to what I have here, let me say, to begin with, a few days ago, I came across in a bookshop a collection of Chinese verse translated into English. At the beginning was the following, written a thousand years ago, and I was very much impressed with it, and permit me to read it to you as a sort of an introduction. This man who wrote in the 11th century, this Chinese, said this: \"Poetry presents the thing in order to convey the feeling.  It should be precise about the thing and reticent about the feeling.\" I thought that was...expressed exactly what I feel, and what I have tried to do, not always, not always, I'm afraid, as well as called for, but a recipe. Among other things, let me begin by reading a couple of things I did also on the way I think verse should be written. And this is from this, By the Waters of Manhattan. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:04:47\nReads \"Salmon and Red Wine\" from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse [also published in Inscriptions: 1944-1956].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:05:39\nThat's the first in this. And the second, I did on the same theme, in a way. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:05:47\nReads \"I have neither the time nor the weaving skill, perhaps\" from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse [also published in Inscriptions: 1944-1956].\n\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:06:13\nNow, let me start with a group which I've written about the city I come from, New York, and its suburbs, and some of its residents, including myself.\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:06:27\nReads \"The winter afternoon darkens\" [from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:06:44\nAnd this I call \"The Scrubwoman\". \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:06:48\nReads \"The Scrubwoman\" [from Rhythms II and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:07:07\nReads \"The peddler who goes from shop to shop\". \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:07:27\nAnd this next. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:07:31\nReads \u201cThe elevator man\" [from Going To and Fro and Walking Up and Down and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse]. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:07:54\nReads \"The shopgirls leave their work\" [from Five Groups of Verse, Rhythms, and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:08:16\nThis one I call \"Cooper Union Library\". I should add, it's no longer that way, this is the way it used to be.\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:08:23\nReads \"Cooper Union Library\" [from \"Going To and Fro and Walking Up and Down and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:08:42\nReads \"Showing a Torn Sleeve\" [from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse and published later in Poems 1918-1936: The Complete Poems of Charles Reznikoff]. \n\nCharles Reznikoff\n00:09:06\nReads \"Two girls of twelve or so at a table\" [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956 and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:09:54\nReads \"I am always surprised to meet\" [from Going To and Fro and Walking Up and Down and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:10:23\nReads \"Rails in the Subway\" [from Jerusalem the Golden and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse]. \n \nAudience\n00:10:35\nLaughter.\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:10:41\nReads \"This subway station, with its electric lights\" [from Going To and Fro and Walking Up and Down and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nAudience\n00:10:58\nLaughter.\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:11:06\nReads \"Among the heaps of brick and plaster lies\" [from Jerusalem the Golden and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:11:18\nReads \"The sky is blue\" [from Jerusalem is Golden].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:11:42\nThis I call \"Suburban River, Winter\".\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:11:48\nReads \"Suburban River, Winter\" [from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:12:07\nAnd this too I call \"Suburban River,\" this is \"Summer\".\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:12:13\nReads \"Suburban River, Summer\" [from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:12:38\nThis I call \"Twilight\".\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:12:40\nReads \"Twilight\" [from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse and published later in The Poems Of Charles Reznikoff 1918\u20131975]. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:12:56\nReads \"Fraser, I think, tells of a Roman\" [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956 and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse; audience laughter throughout].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:13:21\nReads \"The dogs that walk with me\u201d [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956 and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:13:44\nThis I call a \"Fable\".\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:13:46\nReads \"Fable\" [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956 and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse]. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:14:15\nReads \"Scrap of paper\" [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956 and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].  \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:14:28\nReads \"One of my sentinels, a tree\" [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956 and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].   \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:14:45\nReads \"I have not even been in the fields\" [from Rhythms ll and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse]. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:15:01\nReads \"How grey you are!

As many of you, or some of you may know, no doubt, the Jewish New Year's comes in the fall. This is based on it.\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:21:11\nReads \"Meditations on the Fall and Winter Holidays: New Year's\" [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956 and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:23:19\nAnd I call the next one \"The Day of Atonement\".\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:23:24\nReads \"The Day of Atonement\" [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956 and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:24:50\nAnd this I call \"Hanukkah\" which incidentally is a holiday that's just about to come, and it, as some of you may know, it represents the victory, a festival celebrating the victory of the Maccabees over the Syrians, about 150 B.C.E.\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:25:14\nReads \"Hanukkah\" [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956 and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:26:59\nI don't know why I should be having a cold on this occasion but, [laughter], these things [blows nose]. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:27:18\nReads \"The lamps are burning in the synagogue\" [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:28:40\nThis one I call \"Samuel\". Samuel in the Bible, of course.\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:28:47\nReads \"Samuel\" [from Five Groups of Verse and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:30:06\nThese are all from By the Waters of Manhattan, and I'm going to read you, if I may, something quite different, from the volume called Testimony, and which I call \"Recitative\".\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:30:27\nReads \"Recitative\" [from Testimony: the United States (1885-1890); Recitative].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:31:15\nThat's the first. This, these, incidentally, I might say, are all based on law cases. Ah...I don't know what...whether that'll excuse their ferocity, but apparently something like that once happened. The names are different. The facts are the same.\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:31:39\nReads \"Tilda was just a child...\u201d [from Testimony: the United States (1885-1890); Recitative].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:32:49\nAnd this is the third in this. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:32:53\nReads \"Years ago, a company procured a body of land...\" [from Testimony: the United States (1885-1890); Recitative].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:33:44\nNow...let's see, if I may, the time...Here is a poem with which I generally end these readings but I don't intend to end this unless you wish me to because I have some other things to read. But I'll end it right here anyway and then we'll see how much time is left. I call this \"Kaddish\". Now, it's not the Kaddish for mourners that you might know about. It was written at the beginning of the rise of Hitler [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q352]. I did it; I mean, I did the writing, not the Kaddish, which is very old. It was written at the beginning of the rise of Hitler and his influence, and before his extermination program was put into effect. It's really an ancient blessing in the Jewish ritual. And incidentally, I use that word \"Torah,\" and I doubt, it may be strange to many, but James Parks, I notice, in his History of the Jewish People, has defined it, correctly, I think, \"The word Torah,\" he says, \"has been defined as law, but is much wider in meaning. It applies a way of life\".  Now this is this \"Kaddish\".\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:35:09\nReads \"Kaddish\" [from Separate Way and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse]].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:36:43\nThis ends the, let's say the first part. And I'll continue, if you like, with some others, unless you're all...[inaudible]\n \nAudience\n00:36:51\nApplause.\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:37:04\nWell I, if, I shall continue, if you're not all exhausted. I have here, quite a few things that are not arranged in any way, so they're more or less haphazard. And...this is one. Let's see...well this one is \u201cAfter Reading Translations of Ancient Texts on Stone and Clay\u201d.\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:37:37\nReads \u201cAfter Reading Translations of Ancient Texts on Stone and Clay\u201d.\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:38:47\nNow, these, these are much less organized than that, haphazard, you'll have to take them as they come if we keep on. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:39:00\nReads \"As I was wandering with my unhappy thoughts\" [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956 and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n\nCharles Reznikoff\n00:39:36\nReads \"The young fellow walks about with nothing to do\" [from Going To and Fro and Walking Up and Down and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse]. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:40:09\nReads \u201cA well-phrased eulogy\" [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956 and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:40:44\nReads \"On a Sunday, when the place was closed\" [from Going To and Fro and Walking Up and Down].  \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:41:12\nNow here are two earlier testimony, two or more things based on a law case, which I call \"Testimony\", and these were included in that same By the Waters of Manhattan. \n \nBy the Waters of Manhattan. \n00:41:28\nReads \"The Company had advertised for men\" from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:43:13\nThat's the first, and this is the second.\n \nCharles Reznikoff \n00:43:16\nReads \"Amelia was just fourteen\" from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse.\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:44:33\nThat's the second. I have some more I'd like to get at before I close. Well, this I wrote for my wife. Pity she isn't here, but we'll read it in her absence.\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:44:55\nReads \"Malicious women greet you, saying...\" [from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse and published later in The Poems Of Charles Reznikoff 1918\u20131975].  \n\n Charles Reznikoff\n00:45:38\nNow, this, this is a kind of counterpiece to this I have just read. It was not written for my wife. [Laughter].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:45:56\nReads \"He had with him a bag\" [from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse and published later in The Poems Of Charles Reznikoff 1918\u20131975].  \n \nAudience\n00:46:38\nLaughter. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:46:42\nI'm reading this 'cause...\"On a seat\"...maybe it would....I think this is rather appropriate in view of all the Hebrew things I read.\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:46:56\nReads \"On a seat in the subway\" [from Going To and Fro and Walking Up and Down].  \n\nCharles Reznikoff\n00:47:41\nReads \"Permit me to warn you\" [from Jerusalem the Golden and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nAudience\n00:47:51\nLaughter.\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:47:59\nReads \"These days, the papers in the street\" [from Jerusalem the Golden and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].\n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:48:36\nLet me close, unless it...if I should...with something that I tried to do which may be something to close with. This is based on the Book of Ezra [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q131635], and the Book of Ezra, according to my note, I've probably forgotten by this time, is, 'This is a rearrangement and a versification of parts of the Fourth Book of Ezra.' And that's what it's called in the appendix to the Vulgate [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q131175], or two Esdras of the Protestant Apocrypha. And I based this upon a translation of this Book of Ezra from the Syriac by a friend of mine who taught, and I have their permission and all, but the original was probably, there's quite a discussion as to what the original was right, and some scholars believe that it was in Greek, and a Doctor Bocks, who was in, G.H. Bocks, thinks that it was in Hebrew, and Bloch, who was, they had in 42nd Street at the library, didn't think that it was in either Greek or Hebrew, but Aramaic. Anyway, excuse me just, [laughter], anyway, I will read it, and its adaptation of it, and see what one can do with things that you...clear up. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:50:12\nReads \u201cBecause I saw the desolation of Zion\" [from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse and published later in The Poems of Charles Reznikoff: 1918-1975]. \n \nCharles Reznikoff\n00:53:33\nAnd I think this is enough, perhaps, for a time. \n \nAudience\n00:53:36\nApplause.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:54:01\nWhat else, thank you very much, Mr. Reznikoff, and I'd just like to repeat that the next reading is at, two weeks from tonight, December the first, Daryl Hine, who's a graduate of the other university.\n \nEND\n00:54:21\n",

It's a pleasure to welcome him back to Montreal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q340], while attending the 'other' university here; before that he lived in Vancouver [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q24639], where he was born in 1936, and where he began writing poetry at the age of twelve, and publishing it in such magazines as Northern Review [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q15757902] and Contemporary Verse at the age of fifteen. His first book, Five Poems, was published when he was eighteen, and his next, The Carnal and the Crane, established him as an important poet at age 21, when most poets are still cutting their poetic teeth. Since then, his career, like his poetry, has been international, rather than national. After becoming a college dropout, he traveled widely in Europe [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q46] and then in the United States [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30], producing, en route, four other books, The Devil's Picture Book and The Wooden Horse, both of which are poetry, The Prince of Darkness, a novel, and a travel book called Polish Subtitles.  He is currently awaiting the publication of his next book of poetry, to be called Minutes, while teaching in the English department at the University of Chicago [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q131252]. He says that his plans for the future are vague, but he assures me that they include the evasion of Toronto [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q172]. Ladies and gentlemen, Daryl Hine.\n \nAudience\n00:02:03\nApplause.\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:02:11\nI thought I'd begin by reading some poems that I wrote when I lived in Montreal...if I can find some fuel. Poems that are in my second book, which I tend to think of as my first book, The Carnal and the Crane. I'll read the third and fourth of four fabulary satires.\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:02:48\nReads \u201cFour Fabulary Satires\u201d part III from The Carnal and the Crane.\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:04:51\nAnd the fourth satire.\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:04:53\nReads \u201cFour Fabulary Satires\u201d part IV from The Carnal and the Crane.\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:06:56\nThe other poem that I'll read from The Carnal and the Crane is a one-sided dialogue called \"A Bewilderment at the Entrance of the Fat Boy into Eden\". It's in four fairly distinct parts. They're more distinct than the ordinary stanzas in a poem.\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:07:35\nReads \"A Bewilderment at the Entrance of the Fat Boy into Eden\" from The Carnal and the Crane.\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:10:52\nA number of the poems in my next book, The Devil's Picture Book, were also written in Montreal, although the book was published about two years after I left Montreal and went to Europe. I'm going to read one of the longest poems in this book, which is called \"The Double-Goer\".\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:11:41\nReads \"The Double-Goer\" from The Devil\u2019s Picture Book.\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:16:31\nImmediately following that poem in The Devil's Picture Book, which I feel is very accurately titled, immediately after that poem is another much shorter, and...perhaps not really simpler poem on the same subject, the subject which seemed to preoccupy me a great deal at the time and I'm glad to say no longer does. This poem is a villanelle, and it's called \"The Black Swan\".\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:17:12\nReads \"The Black Swan\" from The Devil\u2019s Picture Book.\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:18:38\nThere's a...poem in The Wooden Horse that deals also, perhaps, I think, with the same subject, but in a different way, and at a different stage. It's called \"The Ouija Board\".  It may be that some of you don't know what an ouija board is, in any case, this one wasn't a real ouija board. We made it up using a teacup, an inverted, as I remember, cracked, willow-patterned teacup, on a round circular table top. Four of us operated this by placing a single finger each on the teacup, and we cut out letters of the alphabet and placed them around the table. I did this in company with a friend of mine who's done it for many years, and has developed such perfect communication with the other side that instead of getting the usual scrambled answers that people get in these attempted communications, he gets extremely long, involved, and very literate answers, rather in the style of his own prose writing....[audience laughter] which all purport, or most of them purport to come from a Greek or Roman character called, in this poem Io, he's actually called Ephraim, although perhaps I shouldn't mention it. Anyway, this is about a session with the teacup.\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:20:15\nReads \u201cThe Ouija Board\u201d from The Wooden Horse. \n \nDaryl Hine\n00:21:54\nPerhaps as an alternative to all of this tinkering with the other side, I'll read a poem that is, most of it, very much about this side, called \"Bluebeard's Wife\".\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:22:21\nReads \"Bluebeard's Wife\" from The Wooden Horse.\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:25:46\nThe last poem I'll read from The Wooden Horse is the last poem in The Wooden Horse, and I beg your indulgence, as it's a trifle long. It's called \"The Wave\".\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:26:17\nReads \"The Wave\u201d from The Wooden Horse.\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:31:01\nFour years ago I came back to Montreal on my first visit since I left rather quietly in 1958, and spent the next year after this return visit, which was very pleasant, although very brief, struggling with a poem which I think perhaps is still not quite finished, but I think will go either in this form or some other form into the next book. It's a poem, of course, about the impossibility of writing an autobiographical poem. And it's called \"The Apology\".\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:31:56\nReads \"The Apology\" [published later in Minutes]. \n\nDaryl Hine\n00:35:53\nWell, I've returned to other places than Montreal [audience laughter], and two summers ago I went back just for the summer to Paris [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q90], where I lived for something more than, between three and four years, and I didn't like it very much. And these are two poems from a series that I wrote about not liking it. This one is called \"The March\u00e9 aux Puces and the Jardin des Plantes\"- the March\u00e9 aux Puces is of course the flea market, and the Jardin des Plantes is the botanical and zoological gardens, where I spent, in one place or other I spent most of my afternoons, that rather boring summer in Paris. Having the habit of working in the morning.\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:36:53\nReads \"The March\u00e9 aux Puces and the Jardin des Plantes\" [published later in Minutes; audience laughter throughout]. \n \nDaryl Hine\n00:38:17\nWell, I think perhaps I'll read three of these [inaudible]. The next one will seem familiar to, I'm sure, many of you. I haven't quite decided on a title, it might be called \"Jardin des Gourmets\", or it might be called \"Rendez-vous des routiers\" or something like that, it's about a certain sort of French restaurant.\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:38:42\nReads \"Le Rendezvous des Gourmets\" [published later in Minutes; audience laughter throughout].\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:40:18\nAnd this poem isn't quite as funny [audience laughter], not that I really thought the last one was, but this one is really about Henry James' [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q170509] novel, The Ambassadors [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q650571]. It's also, of course, about being in any town in the off season, in this case, Paris, and of course, Paris in August is emptier than anywhere I've ever been. But, I imagine that other places in their off seasons are the same. It's called \"Cl\u00f4ture annuelle\".\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:40:57\nReads \"Cl\u00f4ture annuelle\" [published later in Minutes].\n\nDaryl Hine\n00:42:19\nI also, this year, or was it last, returned to my place of origin, British Columbia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1974]. A [inaudible] which will be familiar to some of you as the site of the University of British Columbia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q391028], I don't mean the University by any of the architectural things I mention in this poem, but I'm talking about the beach, a very beautiful, barren Pacific beach that lies below Point Grey [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16898567]. \n \nDaryl Hine\n00:43:05\nBegins to read unnamed poem.\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:43:10\nWell...[shuffles paper] I'll read another version, I think. Excuse me. \n \nDaryl Hine\n00:43:18\nReads [\u201cPoint Grey\u201d; published later in Minutes].\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:45:03\nReads unnamed poem.\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:46:12\nThe last poem I'll read, if I can find it...it is called...\"The Trout\".\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:46:50\nReads \"The Trout\" [published later in Minutes].\n \nAudience\n00:48:41\nApplause.\n \nAnnouncer\n00:48:59\nI want to thank Mr. Hine and also announce that the next reading is on January 26th, by the American poet John Logan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6245151].\n \nEND\n00:49:12\n"

His first poems were published when he was fifteen in Contemporary Verse. In 1954 he traveled to Montreal to study classics and philosophy at McGill University, and completed his B.A. by 1958. His first books of poetry published was Five Poems (Emblem Books, 1955), followed by The carnal and the crane (McGill Poetry Series by Contact Press, 1957). In 1968 Hine received a Canada Foundation-Rockefeller fellowship which he used to travel Europe and live in France. In 1962 he returned, and completed his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees at the University of Chicago in comparative literature by 1967. Hine then took on a position teaching English at the University of Chicago, and the next year edited the distinguished Poetry magazine until 1978. By this time Hine had already published The Devil\u2019s Picture Book (Abelard, 1960), Heroics: Five Poems (Grosswiller, 1961), The Wooden Horse (Atheneum, 1965), Minutes (Atheneum, 1969), Resident Alien (Atheneum, 1975), privately printed In and Out in 1975 (reprinted in 1989 by Knopf) and Daylight Saving (Atheneum, 1978). Hine has also translated The Homeric Hymns and the Battle of the Frogs and Mice (Atheneum, 1972), Ovid\u2019s Heroines: A Verse Translations of the Hero Heroides (Yale University Press, 1991) and Puerilities: Erotic Epigrams of The Greek Anthology (Princeton University Press, 2001), several radio and stage plays A Mutual Flame (BBC Radio, 1961), The Death of Seneca (Chicago, 1968) and Alecstis (BBC Radio, 1972). Hine has won several prestigious awards, including the Guggenheim Fellowship in 1980, an American Academy Award in 1982 and a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 1986. He has since published a novel, The Prince of Darkness & Co (Abelard-Schuman, 1961), and poetry collections, including Selected Poems (Oxford University Press, 1980), Academic Festival Overtures (Atheneum, 1985), Postscripts (Random House, 1990), Recollected poems: 1951-2004 (Fitzhenry & Whiteside, 2007) along with dozens of articles and poems in magazines and anthologies. Hine died in 2012. "

                "contents": "Unknown\n00:00:00\nAmbient Sound [voices].\n\nMargaret Atwood\n00:00:12\nI first met Daryl Hine [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5226186] about six years ago in New York [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60], where he was living in the midst of a colony of cockroaches, and on that occasion, he drank me under the table with more ease and urbanity than anybody that's been able to manage since, which is actually a literary comment on the way he writes poetry. It's a pleasure to welcome him back to Montreal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q340], while attending the 'other' university here; before that he lived in Vancouver [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q24639], where he was born in 1936, and where he began writing poetry at the age of twelve, and publishing it in such magazines as Northern Review [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q15757902] and Contemporary Verse at the age of fifteen. His first book, Five Poems, was published when he was eighteen, and his next, The Carnal and the Crane, established him as an important poet at age 21, when most poets are still cutting their poetic teeth. Since then, his career, like his poetry, has been international, rather than national. After becoming a college dropout, he traveled widely in Europe [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q46] and then in the United States [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30], producing, en route, four other books, The Devil's Picture Book and The Wooden Horse, both of which are poetry, The Prince of Darkness, a novel, and a travel book called Polish Subtitles.  He is currently awaiting the publication of his next book of poetry, to be called Minutes, while teaching in the English department at the University of Chicago [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q131252]. He says that his plans for the future are vague, but he assures me that they include the evasion of Toronto [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q172]. Ladies and gentlemen, Daryl Hine.\n \nAudience\n00:02:03\nApplause.\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:02:11\nI thought I'd begin by reading some poems that I wrote when I lived in Montreal...if I can find some fuel. Poems that are in my second book, which I tend to think of as my first book, The Carnal and the Crane. I'll read the third and fourth of four fabulary satires.\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:02:48\nReads \u201cFour Fabulary Satires\u201d part III from The Carnal and the Crane.\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:04:51\nAnd the fourth satire.\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:04:53\nReads \u201cFour Fabulary Satires\u201d part IV from The Carnal and the Crane.\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:06:56\nThe other poem that I'll read from The Carnal and the Crane is a one-sided dialogue called \"A Bewilderment at the Entrance of the Fat Boy into Eden\". It's in four fairly distinct parts. They're more distinct than the ordinary stanzas in a poem.\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:07:35\nReads \"A Bewilderment at the Entrance of the Fat Boy into Eden\" from The Carnal and the Crane.\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:10:52\nA number of the poems in my next book, The Devil's Picture Book, were also written in Montreal, although the book was published about two years after I left Montreal and went to Europe. I'm going to read one of the longest poems in this book, which is called \"The Double-Goer\".\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:11:41\nReads \"The Double-Goer\" from The Devil\u2019s Picture Book.\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:16:31\nImmediately following that poem in The Devil's Picture Book, which I feel is very accurately titled, immediately after that poem is another much shorter, and...perhaps not really simpler poem on the same subject, the subject which seemed to preoccupy me a great deal at the time and I'm glad to say no longer does. This poem is a villanelle, and it's called \"The Black Swan\".\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:17:12\nReads \"The Black Swan\" from The Devil\u2019s Picture Book.\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:18:38\nThere's a...poem in The Wooden Horse that deals also, perhaps, I think, with the same subject, but in a different way, and at a different stage. It's called \"The Ouija Board\".  It may be that some of you don't know what an ouija board is, in any case, this one wasn't a real ouija board. We made it up using a teacup, an inverted, as I remember, cracked, willow-patterned teacup, on a round circular table top. Four of us operated this by placing a single finger each on the teacup, and we cut out letters of the alphabet and placed them around the table. I did this in company with a friend of mine who's done it for many years, and has developed such perfect communication with the other side that instead of getting the usual scrambled answers that people get in these attempted communications, he gets extremely long, involved, and very literate answers, rather in the style of his own prose writing....[audience laughter] which all purport, or most of them purport to come from a Greek or Roman character called, in this poem Io, he's actually called Ephraim, although perhaps I shouldn't mention it. Anyway, this is about a session with the teacup.\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:20:15\nReads \u201cThe Ouija Board\u201d from The Wooden Horse. \n \nDaryl Hine\n00:21:54\nPerhaps as an alternative to all of this tinkering with the other side, I'll read a poem that is, most of it, very much about this side, called \"Bluebeard's Wife\".\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:22:21\nReads \"Bluebeard's Wife\" from The Wooden Horse.\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:25:46\nThe last poem I'll read from The Wooden Horse is the last poem in The Wooden Horse, and I beg your indulgence, as it's a trifle long. It's called \"The Wave\".\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:26:17\nReads \"The Wave\u201d from The Wooden Horse.\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:31:01\nFour years ago I came back to Montreal on my first visit since I left rather quietly in 1958, and spent the next year after this return visit, which was very pleasant, although very brief, struggling with a poem which I think perhaps is still not quite finished, but I think will go either in this form or some other form into the next book. It's a poem, of course, about the impossibility of writing an autobiographical poem. And it's called \"The Apology\".\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:31:56\nReads \"The Apology\" [published later in Minutes]. \n\nDaryl Hine\n00:35:53\nWell, I've returned to other places than Montreal [audience laughter], and two summers ago I went back just for the summer to Paris [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q90], where I lived for something more than, between three and four years, and I didn't like it very much. And these are two poems from a series that I wrote about not liking it. This one is called \"The March\u00e9 aux Puces and the Jardin des Plantes\"- the March\u00e9 aux Puces is of course the flea market, and the Jardin des Plantes is the botanical and zoological gardens, where I spent, in one place or other I spent most of my afternoons, that rather boring summer in Paris. Having the habit of working in the morning.\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:36:53\nReads \"The March\u00e9 aux Puces and the Jardin des Plantes\" [published later in Minutes; audience laughter throughout]. \n \nDaryl Hine\n00:38:17\nWell, I think perhaps I'll read three of these [inaudible]. The next one will seem familiar to, I'm sure, many of you. I haven't quite decided on a title, it might be called \"Jardin des Gourmets\", or it might be called \"Rendez-vous des routiers\" or something like that, it's about a certain sort of French restaurant.\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:38:42\nReads \"Le Rendezvous des Gourmets\" [published later in Minutes; audience laughter throughout].\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:40:18\nAnd this poem isn't quite as funny [audience laughter], not that I really thought the last one was, but this one is really about Henry James' [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q170509] novel, The Ambassadors [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q650571]. It's also, of course, about being in any town in the off season, in this case, Paris, and of course, Paris in August is emptier than anywhere I've ever been. But, I imagine that other places in their off seasons are the same. It's called \"Cl\u00f4ture annuelle\".\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:40:57\nReads \"Cl\u00f4ture annuelle\" [published later in Minutes].\n\nDaryl Hine\n00:42:19\nI also, this year, or was it last, returned to my place of origin, British Columbia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1974]. A [inaudible] which will be familiar to some of you as the site of the University of British Columbia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q391028], I don't mean the University by any of the architectural things I mention in this poem, but I'm talking about the beach, a very beautiful, barren Pacific beach that lies below Point Grey [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16898567]. \n \nDaryl Hine\n00:43:05\nBegins to read unnamed poem.\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:43:10\nWell...[shuffles paper] I'll read another version, I think. Excuse me. \n \nDaryl Hine\n00:43:18\nReads [\u201cPoint Grey\u201d; published later in Minutes].\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:45:03\nReads unnamed poem.\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:46:12\nThe last poem I'll read, if I can find it...it is called...\"The Trout\".\n \nDaryl Hine\n00:46:50\nReads \"The Trout\" [published later in Minutes].\n \nAudience\n00:48:41\nApplause.\n \nAnnouncer\n00:48:59\nI want to thank Mr. Hine and also announce that the next reading is on January 26th, by the American poet John Logan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6245151].\n \nEND\n00:49:12\n",

I'm still concerned about the situation of the lights. Light's one of the big problems in poetry. [Audience laughter]. This is \"Two Preludes for La Push\", and it\u2019s dedicated to Michael Ross [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q21280686]. It was written when I was teaching [Wetky's (?)] courses a couple of years ago in Seattle [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5083] for a couple of quarters. The physical beauty of the North West got me very involved and I wrote a number of poems about it, of which this was the first. La Push [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q554902], Washington [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1223] is a city on the coast--city, no it's a hamlet on the coast, very poverty stricken Indian populated, really a ruined community with dead cars lying around and houses falling apart, but in the summer many people come there because of its superb beauty. I found that I couldn't write about the Indian community, I wrote rather about the sea and myself.\n \nJohn Logan\n00:05:38\nReads \"Two Preludes for La Push\" [published later in The Zigzag Walk].\n \nJohn Logan\n00:07:48\nI'm sorry it bothers me when people come in late, I'm temperamental about that, you'll just have to excuse me. It's not that they're late, you know, it has no respect for the poem, they could wait until it's over. I'll go back to the second part.\n \nJohn Logan\n00:08:13\nResumes reading \"Two Preludes for La Push\" [published later in The Zigzag Walk].\n \nJohn Logan\n00:10:57\nThis is another poem about a superb place in the North West called Deception Pass [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1181773], which is a pass really--a water pass between islands, Deception Island [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q49636439] is the name of the poem which the poem takes its name.\n \nJohn Logan\n00:11:39\nReads \"The Pass\" [published later in The Zigzag Walk].\n \nJohn Logan\n00:13:32\nI lived on a houseboat for a while, in Seattle, which I certainly think that everybody who considers going to Seattle ought to do. In fact, I was living on a houseboat when the tidal wave struck in the spring of that year. That is a marvelous thrill, it woke me up. I became friends with ducks there, I was living alone, and the poem is partly about that. \"Three Moves in Six Months\". You'll have to forgive me, I don't have this poem with me, I wanted to remember it, I'll see if I can.\n \nJohn Logan\n00:14:29\nReads \"Three Moves\" [published later in The Zigzag Walk].\n \nJohn Logan\n00:15:45\nI'm sorry, I can't remember this poem now. I'll try it again in the second half of the program, I'm screwing it up. [Audience laughter]. I'll read you another poem, I'll try that one later. This is called \"Poem, Slow to Come, on the Death of Cummings, (1896-1962)\". There are two epigraphs, one from a student of mine who said  \"I care more about strawberries than about death\", and one from Rilke [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q76483], who wrote \"Heir, es ist zeit\".\n \nJohn Logan\n00:16:43\nReads \"Poem, Slow to Come, on the Death of Cummings, (1896-1962)\" [published later in The Zigzag Walk].\n \nJohn Logan\n00:22:27\nI'll read one more poem then would like to take a break, and begin again. It's called \"Love Poem\". I said that as though it didn't matter that it's called that. It does.\n \nJohn Logan\n00:23:17\nReads \"Love Poem\" [published later in The Zigzag Walk].\n\nAudience \n00:25:35 \nApplause.\n\nUnknown\n00:25:49\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n\nUnknown\n00:25:50\nAmbient Sound [voices].\n\nJohn Logan\n00:26:27\nI was just asked to read another, earlier poem, which I'm glad to do. Why not? I still like this poem. Then I'll come back and read some more recent things. Did we decide we'll try this without the lamp at all? I think we did, because it seems to get in the way of people. I think that people are more important than I am. Is that worse? Probably if you can't see me it should be marvelous. It\u2019s called \"A Trip to Four or Five Towns\" and I dedicated it to James Wright [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6145850], simply because he liked it. There's a reference toward the end of the poem to a visit to William Carlos Williams [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q178106], and there's also a reference to a story about e.e. cummings [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q298703], told by Charles Norman in his biography of cummings about a long night spent at [Archebold (?)] and [unintelligible] with them living in France [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q142], cummings was working for the New York Herald Tribune [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q532494], I think, perhaps another New York [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60] paper, there aren't that many. But on the way back from the party, cummings had the urge to take a leak, and so he did so, but it was Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q550] or some extraordinary [audience laughter] place like that and the cops saw him. They brought him to jail, and they said, 'You piss on Paris [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q90]' [audience laughter]. He said, 'No ,it's not the point, I just had to take a leak', but they kept him there the whole night and when he finally got back to his office in the morning they had signs posted up around, which said--and I don't read French, I'm sorry because I know that many of you know French--but it was something like this, \u201c[unintelligible] pisseur Americain\u201d, which I guess translated \"Let the American pisser go\". [Audience laughter]. This was \"A Trip to Four or Five Towns\u201d.\n \nJohn Logan\n00:29:01\nReads \"A Trip to Four of Five Towns\" [from Ghosts of the Heart]..\n \nJohn Logan\n00:38:34\nI realize reading the poem now how dated it is with the reference to the capital of [Viscount(?)] claim, which sold out some time ago to I don't know, somebody that sold out to somebody else. Williams by the way, did not read his Sixteen new poems, he had them, but he couldn't read them because he'd had a stroke and had never heard them. I visited him with Galway Kinnell [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2425705], and he asked us to read the poems, and we did. But I thought that, you know, one of the great things about poetry is that you can make it the way that it should be, so I had him read the poems. This is \"Big Sur: Partington Cove\". I went with a couple of students to, well we were in the Big Sur [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q859413], and this is a very hidden place, Partington Cove [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q21551591]. A marvelous place, accessible only by a tunnel shored up by ancient timbers, I feel I am sort of repeating the poem by telling you this, but there is such a cove, and you can only reach it through a tunnel, it's very beautiful. Smugglers used the cove and a cave nearby to hide booze during the prohibition, it was used for other purposes before and since, and there are--well why not? [Audience laughter]. But you can't get there at all now, I tried to revisit when I was back there last spring, but it's all roped off. And even the one time I did get to go there, there was a sign that was supposed to scare you away. The, one of the motivating things behind the poem was my understanding for the first time of what happens in some paintings that a friend of mine Jim Johnson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q100239918] does, where he uses combinations of landscape and the human body. He will have for example, mountains coming off an arm, and the figure of a clown. I had an experience which this poem talks about that made me see for the first time the kind of rapport between body and landscape. It was important to me, and part of what happens to the poem.\n \nJohn Logan\n00:41:54\nReads \"Big Sur: Partington Cove\" [published later in The Zigzag Walk].\n \nJohn Logan\n00:50:45\nReads \"Three Moves\" [in full, published later in The Zigzag Walk].\n\nAudience\n00:53:56 \nApplause. \n\nJohn Logan\n00:53:56\nI'm glad I finally read a poem you liked. [Laughter]. I'll read two more, they're both new, one is fairly long and one is fairly short. This one is called \u201cLines on Locks (or Jail and the Erie Canal)\u201d. It's based on an experience of being in jail along the Erie Canal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q459578]. The name of the town is Herkimer [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3134036], New York [audience laughter] and I guess I won't go into the background of it, it's not that interesting. But it was written there. Not long ago.\n \nJohn Logan\n00:55:00\nReads \"Lines on Locks (or Jail and the Erie Canal)\" [published later in The Zigzag Walk].\n \nJohn Logan\n01:02:31\nAnd finally, read \"The Search\". Which is my most recent poem. If you knew how few poems there have been lately, that would mean more but...\n \nJohn Logan\n01:03:03\nReads \"The Search\" [published later in The Zigzag Walk].\n\nAudience \n01:07:31\nApplause.\n\nJohn Logan\n01:07:48\nThank you [audience applause continues throughout].\n\nIntroducer\n01:08:04\nThanks very much John [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6245151], just several announcements before we go. Fred Cogswell [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5494855], who is visiting us this year, has been invited by the Sir George Williams Student Literary Society to read his poetry, next Friday evening, in the students' lounge on the sixth floor. Jorge Luis Borges [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q909], the distinguished--[audience laughter] you're not making it easier--the distinguished author will be coming here, to Sir George Williams [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q326342], on Thursday February the 29th and I think I have this right. He's changed the title of his talk, it will be \"Beginnings of English Poetry\". Our next reading, John Newlove [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6250356] and Joe Rosenblatt [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1691575], two weeks from...\n\nUnknown\n01:09:05\n[Cut or edit made in tape.

Later he pursued more graduate work at Georgetown University and at the University of Notre Dame. He taught English at St. John\u2019s College in Maryland and at the University of Notre Dame, finally settling in as a professor at the State University of New York in Buffalo. He married, and fathered nine children but divorced later on in his life. His first of fourteen publications was Cycle for Mother Cabrini (Grove Press), published in 1955. Two collections followed, Ghosts of the Heart: New Poems (University of Chicago Press) in 1960 and Spring of the Thief: Poems 1960-1962 (Knopf) in 1963. In 1969, Logan published a selection of his poems written since 1963 in The Zig-Zag Walk: Poems 1963-1968 (E.P. Dutton), and in 1973 The Anonymous Lover: New Poems (Liveright) came out. The bridge of change: poems, 1974-1980 (BOA Editions) was published in 1981, along with Only the dreamer can change the dream (Ecco Press, 1981), which won the Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize the following year. Logan\u2019s prose was collected in A Bullet for the Ear: Interviews, Essays and Reviews (Ann Arbor, 1983) edited by A. Poulin, Jr. Logan received a Rockefeller Foundation grant, Morton Dauwen Zabel Award, Guggenheim Fellowship, and a Wayne State University\u2019s Miles Modern Poetry Prize. He was the poetry editor of The Nation and Critic, and founded Choice magazine. John Logan died in 1987, and his poetry was published posthumously in The Collected Poems (BOA Editions) in 1989.\n"

                "contents": "John Logan\n00:00:00\nReads \u201cEight Poems on Portraits of the Foot\u201d [recording begins abruptly].\n \nJohn Logan\n00:03:37\nNow, can you see over there? I'm still concerned about the situation of the lights. Light's one of the big problems in poetry. [Audience laughter]. This is \"Two Preludes for La Push\", and it\u2019s dedicated to Michael Ross [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q21280686]. It was written when I was teaching [Wetky's (?)] courses a couple of years ago in Seattle [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5083] for a couple of quarters. The physical beauty of the North West got me very involved and I wrote a number of poems about it, of which this was the first. La Push [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q554902], Washington [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1223] is a city on the coast--city, no it's a hamlet on the coast, very poverty stricken Indian populated, really a ruined community with dead cars lying around and houses falling apart, but in the summer many people come there because of its superb beauty. I found that I couldn't write about the Indian community, I wrote rather about the sea and myself.\n \nJohn Logan\n00:05:38\nReads \"Two Preludes for La Push\" [published later in The Zigzag Walk].\n \nJohn Logan\n00:07:48\nI'm sorry it bothers me when people come in late, I'm temperamental about that, you'll just have to excuse me. It's not that they're late, you know, it has no respect for the poem, they could wait until it's over. I'll go back to the second part.\n \nJohn Logan\n00:08:13\nResumes reading \"Two Preludes for La Push\" [published later in The Zigzag Walk].\n \nJohn Logan\n00:10:57\nThis is another poem about a superb place in the North West called Deception Pass [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1181773], which is a pass really--a water pass between islands, Deception Island [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q49636439] is the name of the poem which the poem takes its name.\n \nJohn Logan\n00:11:39\nReads \"The Pass\" [published later in The Zigzag Walk].\n \nJohn Logan\n00:13:32\nI lived on a houseboat for a while, in Seattle, which I certainly think that everybody who considers going to Seattle ought to do. In fact, I was living on a houseboat when the tidal wave struck in the spring of that year. That is a marvelous thrill, it woke me up. I became friends with ducks there, I was living alone, and the poem is partly about that. \"Three Moves in Six Months\". You'll have to forgive me, I don't have this poem with me, I wanted to remember it, I'll see if I can.\n \nJohn Logan\n00:14:29\nReads \"Three Moves\" [published later in The Zigzag Walk].\n \nJohn Logan\n00:15:45\nI'm sorry, I can't remember this poem now. I'll try it again in the second half of the program, I'm screwing it up. [Audience laughter]. I'll read you another poem, I'll try that one later. This is called \"Poem, Slow to Come, on the Death of Cummings, (1896-1962)\". There are two epigraphs, one from a student of mine who said  \"I care more about strawberries than about death\", and one from Rilke [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q76483], who wrote \"Heir, es ist zeit\".\n \nJohn Logan\n00:16:43\nReads \"Poem, Slow to Come, on the Death of Cummings, (1896-1962)\" [published later in The Zigzag Walk].\n \nJohn Logan\n00:22:27\nI'll read one more poem then would like to take a break, and begin again. It's called \"Love Poem\". I said that as though it didn't matter that it's called that. It does.\n \nJohn Logan\n00:23:17\nReads \"Love Poem\" [published later in The Zigzag Walk].\n\nAudience \n00:25:35 \nApplause.\n\nUnknown\n00:25:49\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n\nUnknown\n00:25:50\nAmbient Sound [voices].\n\nJohn Logan\n00:26:27\nI was just asked to read another, earlier poem, which I'm glad to do. Why not? I still like this poem. Then I'll come back and read some more recent things. Did we decide we'll try this without the lamp at all? I think we did, because it seems to get in the way of people. I think that people are more important than I am. Is that worse? Probably if you can't see me it should be marvelous. It\u2019s called \"A Trip to Four or Five Towns\" and I dedicated it to James Wright [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6145850], simply because he liked it. There's a reference toward the end of the poem to a visit to William Carlos Williams [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q178106], and there's also a reference to a story about e.e. cummings [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q298703], told by Charles Norman in his biography of cummings about a long night spent at [Archebold (?)] and [unintelligible] with them living in France [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q142], cummings was working for the New York Herald Tribune [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q532494], I think, perhaps another New York [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60] paper, there aren't that many. But on the way back from the party, cummings had the urge to take a leak, and so he did so, but it was Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q550] or some extraordinary [audience laughter] place like that and the cops saw him. They brought him to jail, and they said, 'You piss on Paris [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q90]' [audience laughter]. He said, 'No ,it's not the point, I just had to take a leak', but they kept him there the whole night and when he finally got back to his office in the morning they had signs posted up around, which said--and I don't read French, I'm sorry because I know that many of you know French--but it was something like this, \u201c[unintelligible] pisseur Americain\u201d, which I guess translated \"Let the American pisser go\". [Audience laughter]. This was \"A Trip to Four or Five Towns\u201d.\n \nJohn Logan\n00:29:01\nReads \"A Trip to Four of Five Towns\" [from Ghosts of the Heart]..\n \nJohn Logan\n00:38:34\nI realize reading the poem now how dated it is with the reference to the capital of [Viscount(?)] claim, which sold out some time ago to I don't know, somebody that sold out to somebody else. Williams by the way, did not read his Sixteen new poems, he had them, but he couldn't read them because he'd had a stroke and had never heard them. I visited him with Galway Kinnell [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2425705], and he asked us to read the poems, and we did. But I thought that, you know, one of the great things about poetry is that you can make it the way that it should be, so I had him read the poems. This is \"Big Sur: Partington Cove\". I went with a couple of students to, well we were in the Big Sur [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q859413], and this is a very hidden place, Partington Cove [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q21551591]. A marvelous place, accessible only by a tunnel shored up by ancient timbers, I feel I am sort of repeating the poem by telling you this, but there is such a cove, and you can only reach it through a tunnel, it's very beautiful. Smugglers used the cove and a cave nearby to hide booze during the prohibition, it was used for other purposes before and since, and there are--well why not? [Audience laughter]. But you can't get there at all now, I tried to revisit when I was back there last spring, but it's all roped off. And even the one time I did get to go there, there was a sign that was supposed to scare you away. The, one of the motivating things behind the poem was my understanding for the first time of what happens in some paintings that a friend of mine Jim Johnson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q100239918] does, where he uses combinations of landscape and the human body. He will have for example, mountains coming off an arm, and the figure of a clown. I had an experience which this poem talks about that made me see for the first time the kind of rapport between body and landscape. It was important to me, and part of what happens to the poem.\n \nJohn Logan\n00:41:54\nReads \"Big Sur: Partington Cove\" [published later in The Zigzag Walk].\n \nJohn Logan\n00:50:45\nReads \"Three Moves\" [in full, published later in The Zigzag Walk].\n\nAudience\n00:53:56 \nApplause. \n\nJohn Logan\n00:53:56\nI'm glad I finally read a poem you liked. [Laughter]. I'll read two more, they're both new, one is fairly long and one is fairly short. This one is called \u201cLines on Locks (or Jail and the Erie Canal)\u201d. It's based on an experience of being in jail along the Erie Canal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q459578]. The name of the town is Herkimer [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3134036], New York [audience laughter] and I guess I won't go into the background of it, it's not that interesting. But it was written there. Not long ago.\n \nJohn Logan\n00:55:00\nReads \"Lines on Locks (or Jail and the Erie Canal)\" [published later in The Zigzag Walk].\n \nJohn Logan\n01:02:31\nAnd finally, read \"The Search\". Which is my most recent poem. If you knew how few poems there have been lately, that would mean more but...\n \nJohn Logan\n01:03:03\nReads \"The Search\" [published later in The Zigzag Walk].\n\nAudience \n01:07:31\nApplause.\n\nJohn Logan\n01:07:48\nThank you [audience applause continues throughout].\n\nIntroducer\n01:08:04\nThanks very much John [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6245151], just several announcements before we go. Fred Cogswell [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5494855], who is visiting us this year, has been invited by the Sir George Williams Student Literary Society to read his poetry, next Friday evening, in the students' lounge on the sixth floor. Jorge Luis Borges [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q909], the distinguished--[audience laughter] you're not making it easier--the distinguished author will be coming here, to Sir George Williams [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q326342], on Thursday February the 29th and I think I have this right. He's changed the title of his talk, it will be \"Beginnings of English Poetry\". Our next reading, John Newlove [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6250356] and Joe Rosenblatt [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1691575], two weeks from...\n\nUnknown\n01:09:05\n[Cut or edit made in tape.

Well, welcome to the sixth reading of our second series of evenings with Canadian and American poets. Tonight we have Joe Rosenblatt [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1691575], Toronto [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q172], and John Newlove [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6250356], formerly of Vancouver [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q24639], now residing in Nova Scotia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1952]. Joe Rosenblatt will begin the reading, there will be an intermission, and John Newlove will follow. I'm going to quote largely from the copy in Joe Rosenblatt's book, The LSD Leacock, for I hope servient biographical information. It goes like this, he was born in Toronto on December the 26th, nineteen hundred and thirty-three. He says that he has suffocated in Toronto ever since then. He attended the Central Technical School [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5061898] and dropped out in Grade 10, he has worked as a grave-digger, plumber's helper, civil servant, railway express misanthrope. He has attended the Provincial Institute of Trades where he acquired a diploma as a welder fitter, his favourite writers are Ambrose Biers, William Blake [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q41513], Emily Dickinson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4441], and A.M. Klein [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2778027], and his favourite dream, is Cyclops turning up at a [nigh-bank (?)]. [Audience laughter]. His previous book of poems, which was probably printed in nineteen hundred and sixty-three, is called Voyage of the Mood. Joe Rosenblatt.\n \nAudience\n00:02:27\nApplause.\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:02:36\nWasn't that [unintelligible]. I'm just going to read, start off with a series of poems I had written about my uncle, who was a fishmonger. He had a habit of phyxiating and murdering fish, and slicing them, and slicing them, and...well, I'll start. This is called \"Uncle Nathan: Blessed his memory, speaketh in land-locked green\".\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:03:11\nReads \"Uncle Nathan: Blessed his memory, speaketh in land-locked green\" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].\n\nAudience\n00:06:10\nApplause.\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:06:16\n\"Ichthycide\". Another poem about my uncle. It's funny, really. [Audience laughter].\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:06:29\nReads \"Ichthycide\" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].\n \nAudience\n00:08:05\nLaughter and applause .\n\nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:08:13\nThis is called \"A Shell Game\". Has to do with my uncle. [Audience laughter]. It's about his funeral.  Joke.\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:08:27\nReads \"A Shell Game [from Winter of the Luna Moth].\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:09:42\nI wrote all kinds of poems. I was in Vancouver and I came across the god-awful logic of the zoo. It kinda scared the hell out of me. It was a bat. I've never seen a bat before. Met people who were bats. But this was the real McCoy, it was a fruit bat and it was hanging upside-down, you know, that's the way they live and they fornicate that way too, apparently, upside-down. So I wrote about bats. I have some more fish poems but I get tired of that after a while, you start hating it. And we'll begin with \"Bats\". While it's true the bat is a mammal, not a bird, there's all types of kinds of mythology based on prejudice about bats and which I've tried to embody in these poems. \n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:10:47\nReads \"Bats\" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:11:32\nOutside of the bat poem there came a group of sound poetry. Because I tried to get the feeling of the bat in the air, you know the image of the bat and the way it, and the movements of the bat. And this is called \"The Fruit Bat\". First encounter with a bat.\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:11:56\nReads \"The Fruit Bat\" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:13:16\nThis is better. This is \u201cThe Bat Cage\u201d.\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:13:19\nReads \u201cThe Bat Cage\u201d [from Winter of the Luna Moth]. \n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:14:39\nOh we're like bats to people. We used to have, I used to, when I was a kid I went to school and we had a music teacher who was a bit of a nut. She used to rap kids across the knuckles, you know, just to hear them singing. [Audience laughter]. I may have called her Mrs. Love, I can't recall, the trauma was too great. \n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:15:02\nReads \u201cThe Vampire\u201d [from Winter of the Luna Moth].\n \nAudience\n00:15:48\nLaughter and applause.\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:15:55\n\"The Zombie\". Just whistle when you get tired of these bat poems. Do anything you wanna do. \"The Zombie\". By the way, bats are supposed to be unkosher according to Leviticus [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q41490]. It says all fowl that creep going upon all fours shall be an abomination unto you. But in other countries they're great appetizers, the fruit bat especially, and I have an interesting poem, not right now though. \"The Zombie\".\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:16:26\nReads \"The Zombie\" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:17:59\nI'll read one more bat poem, it's the sound thing, an experimental thing which I later developed...too many of these bats here. I wrote a Christmas poem on bats, too. Maybe I should read it. Dedicated to somebody. I'll read the sound poem. It's more important. \"The Butterfly Bat\". There is a butterfly bat. Hm, found in the Orient, a very beautiful bat, orange apparently, very beautiful though. \n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:18:43\nReads \"The Butterfly Bat\" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:20:02\nReads \"Orpheus in Stanley Park\" [from Winter of the Luna Moth]. \n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:20:50\n\"Sex and Death\". This poem's for a friend of mine. \n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:20:54\nReads \"Sex and Death\" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:21:48\nI should read the egg poems, because I don't think many of you have heard them, and I'll do that. You'd probably like them better than the bats. More meaningful. This is called \"Egg Sonata\".\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:22:20\nReads \"Egg Sonata\" [from The LSD Leacock].\n \nAudience\n00:23:38\nLaughter and applause.\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:23:44\nReads [\"Let the egg live\" (?)].\n \nUnknown\n00:24:56\nSilence [cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:24:59\nReads \"It's in the egg, in the little round egg\" [from The LSD Leacock].\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:26:57\nOne more egg poem. [Audience laughter and applause]. This is a prose poem. It's called \"The Easter I got for Passover\". [Audience laughter]. It has to do with an argument, whether the body of Christ did not go to heaven, the moderator of the United Church of Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q198745] said yesterday, Right Reverend Ernest Marshall Howes told a press conference that he does not believe in the physical resurrection of Jesus but does believe in a spiritual resurrection. That's from the Globe and Mail [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q43148750], 23rd of April, '65.\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:27:46\nReads \"The Easter I got for Passover\" [from The LSD Leacock].\n \nAudience\n00:30:02\nApplause. \n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:30:10\nDo you want to read, John? Where is he? [Audience laughter]. Do you want me to come here? Yeah, okay. I'm getting down to my dirty poems, what am I going to do? I wrote a whole bunch of pornographic poetry, right. I'll read that for the end when the time's up. I wrote a poem to Che Guevara [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5809], if I can find the thing now, because I really muddled everything up here, oh here it is. It's called \"The Beehive: An Elegy to Che Guevara\".\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:30:52\nReads \"The Beehive: An Elegy to Che Guevara\" [from Winter of the Luna Moth]. \n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:31:42\nA poem about a critic, \u201cFable\u201d.\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:31:47\nReads \u201cFable\u201d [from Winter of the Luna Moth].  \n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:32:37\nI wrote another one about a critic, a friend of mine. It's called \"The Crab Louse\". I'll read it. [Audience laughter]. I think some of you may recognize him. \n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:32:47\nReads \"The Crab Louse\".\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:33:25\nReads \"The Fire Bug Poet\".\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:34:29\n\"How Mice Make Love,\" how'd this get in here? \"How Mice Make Love\".\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:34:36\nReads \"How Mice Make Love\" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:35:29\n\"The Electric Rose\".\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:35:34\nReads \"The Electric Rose\" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].\n \nAudience\n00:37:13\nApplause.\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:37:17\nShould I read on? Well this is a poem called \"Itch\". It's about that cat who, you know, in the world of the dead. And as usual I mucked up all the mythology, but it was too late to change the poem. So I said, what the hell. \n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:37:44\nReads \"Itch\" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:41:51\nThere's a loathsome typographical error in here. That's what happens.\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:41:56\nResumes reading \"Itch\" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:43:20\n[Unintelligible] a more cheerful poem, if I can find one here. How about \"Cricket Love\"? I'll read one very early poem I wrote, \"Better She Dressed in a Black Garment\". \n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:43:39\nReads \"Better She Dressed in a Black Garment\" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:44:21\nThank you. \n \nAudience\n00:44:22\nApplause.\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:44:35\nThere'll be a fifteen minute inter- [cut off abruptly]. \n \nEND\n00:44:37\n\n\njohn_newlove_i006-11-143.mp3 [File 2 of 2]\n\nRoy Kiyooka\n00:00:00\nWell, it gives me a very special kind of pleasure to introduce John Newlove. An old and dear friend. We met in the fall of '61 in Vancouver, and both of us had come from Saskatchewan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1989] to Vancouver. I think that some of John's most memorable early poems have to do with the fact of Saskatchewan.  It's perhaps not an exaggeration to say that the place does continue to haunt him, and hopefully that the exorcism is not complete and that we may get some more Saskatchewan poems. Subsequently, and this is still in Vancouver, we shared a studio, or rather, he shared my studio [audience laughter], for a period of little over a year. Now during this time, we played marathon games of chess, ate several hundred dozens of chocolate-coated Long Johns, scribbled poems, dribbled paint, drank cheap red wine...and read through at least a dozen five-foot shelves of great and lesser works of literature, not to mention the confusion of mice, drunken poets, women, painters, and assorted kooks who kept visiting us. Now, it was during this period that his first book, called Grave Sirs was printed, and I have in italics here \"more or less.\" If you want to know the history of that book, you can ask John. I think there must be fifty odd copies that are still unbound someplace. This was printed by Robert Reed. It was followed by a second, called Elephants, Mothers, and Others, done by Tak Tanabe, again in Vancouver, and subsequent to that, it was rumored that Robert Columbo had discovered John Newlove for Canadian poetry [audience laughter], when he collected some of his works together in an anthology called Poetry '64. Now. Following this, of course, Contact Press bought out his book, Moving in Alone, which was perhaps the book that brought him his first large-scale critical attention. Meanwhile, of course, I'd come here, and some time afterwards I received a book, a wee book, called...let's see. [Audience laughter]. Can't read my own printing here. What They Say. Yes, What They Say is a wee book of poems, it's made up of the rejects from his manuscript that he submitted to McClelland and Stewart [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6800322]. McClelland and Stewart is to bring out his next book of poems called Black Night Window, when they get around to doing it. The manuscript has been in their hands for over twenty-four months. There has been much other activity which include three, two years and a third one coming up as poet in residence at Deep Springs [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5250324] in California [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q99]. I want to conclude this little preamble by saying that at the time that John moved out of our studio, I took over this room that he slept in and wrote poetry in. The mattress in this room was about sixteen inches from the floor, and on two sides, on the wall, there was copious scribbling.  Most of it were quotations from Heraclitus [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q41155] that he was reading at that time.\n \nAudience\n00:04:43\nApplause.\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:04:51\nThey weren't quotations from whoever, whatever Greek name that was you just made up, [audience laughter], they were from Herodotus [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q26825]. And, Roy [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3445789] might have mentioned that, while I suppose technically you could say I was sharing the studio, I was paying half the rent.  Almost half the rent. I was paying some rent. [Audience laughter]. And he never mentioned who won most of the chess games. I write a lot of...who's throwing things at me?  You didn't win any chess games. [Audience laughter]. And you weren't paying any rent, either. I write a lot of poems about dreams, one night I woke up with a dream about an Australian chief and I managed to write down most of it. It's called \"The Almost King\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:05:42\nReads \"The Almost King\" [audience laughter throughout].\n\nJohn Newlove\n00:08:32\nWell, when you have dreams like that, you don't really have much chance. I've a number of short poems, I'm told it's not good to give them at poetry readings because people don't listen fast enough or something. But. [Laughter]. This...Yes, that ashtray is stolen from the faculty club, George, and your wife stole it. [Audience laughter]. This one is called \"The Candle\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:09:07\nReads \"The Candle\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:09:19\nAgain a dream. This poem, misprinted in the Malahat Review [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1567225], is one that I most like. It's called \"The Engine and the Sea\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:09:32\nReads \"The Engine and the Sea\" [published later in The Cave and in The Fat Man].\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:11:26\nLove poems about sleep. And about dreams. This one is called \"Before Sleep\". I used to have a great deal of trouble going to sleep because I was afraid I would have nightmares.\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:11:44\nReads \"Before Sleep\" [later published in The Cave and in The Fat Man].\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:12:53\nAnd again another one about dreams, this one called \"The Dream Man\u201d. Dreamed I once wrote a dream about somebody else's dream, but that's not fair, dreams are copyright. This was my own. [Audience laughter].\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:13:09\nReads \"The Dream Man\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:14:35\nAccording to the rules, you're supposed to say things in between poems, but I can't really ever think of anything appropriate to say in between them, so. I used to have some nice Ed Sullivan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q83807] routines, but I've forgotten them. This poem is called \"Burn\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:14:52\nReads \"Burn\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:15:16\nAnd this one, an old one, again fairly short. It's called \"No Song\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:15:25\nReads \"No Song\" [from Black Night Window and published later in The Fat Man].\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:15:47\nI have a poem I wrote for and about a friend, but after the poem was finished as you may see, I showed it to him but I didn't tell him it was about him. He said it was a very good poem and very accurate, and so on. But he didn't know it was about himself. It's called, \"What do you want, what do you want?\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:16:06\nReads \"What do you want, what do you want?\" [from Black Night Window and later published in The Fat Man; audience laughter and applause throughout].\n  \nJohn Newlove\n00:17:01\nAfter he said it was such an accurate poem, I couldn't tell him it was about him. This one's called \"Strand by Strand\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:17:14\nReads \"Strand by Strand\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:17:56\nThis is the first time I've kept to a list of...because usually I decide that I don't want to read a particular poem and I get all confused, but I'm very pleased with myself when I keep right to the schedule. Everything organized, everything complete. This short poem in five naturally short pieces is called \"One Day\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:18:23\nReads \"One Day\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:18:55\nCharles Williams [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q124735] died in about 1953, he was an Englishman, originally Cockney. He wrote a number of what I think are very good poems, a number of detective novels, some theological deputation, I guess would be the right word. One of his detective novels is about finding the holy grail. It's called War in Heaven and it's out in Faber Paperback, go and buy it, it's really nice. This poem is for and from and about Charles Williams.\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:19:35\nReads \u201cFor and From Charles Williams\u201d [from What They Say].\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:20:04\nNow my list has gone to pot, because I've got a poem down in a magazine that I didn't bring. So. One day some years ago, I was hitchhiking out to British Columbia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1974]. I got to a place called Golden [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1020179], B.C. and I had to go up the Big Bend Highway [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30253222], this would be before the Rogers Pass [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q383051] was open. And I got a ride about thirty miles in on what I didn't know was an illegally-present logging truck, because the Big Bend Highway was not open to traffic for three more days. So I sat three days on the Big Bend Highway. This poem roughly...well, it's called \"Solitaire\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:20:47\nReads \"Solitaire\" [from Black Night Window and published later in The Fat Man].\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:21:22\nThis short one called \"El Paso\" because El Paso was the place where it happens. It was ninety degrees outside in El Paso [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16562], and with the air conditioning, which I couldn't turn off, it was about thirty below. And I couldn't sleep, I had to get up in the middle of the night and get dressed and get under the blankets, and I caught terrible cold in that motel. \n \nJohn Newlove\n00:21:41\nReads \"El Paso\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:21:56\nSince I've been out of Nova Scotia, I've written a couple of poems about or around Nova Scotia. The main thing I can't seem to get in a poem just yet is the difference between the Pacific Ocean [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q98], in Vancouver, and the Atlantic [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q97]. There seems a tremendous difference that I can feel but that I can't seem yet to grasp in the fact. This poem is called \"God Bless You\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:22:24\nReads \"God Bless You\" [later published in The Cave and in The Fat Man].\n \nAudience\n00:22:43\nLaughter.\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:22:47\nThe next piece is on the back of my list. I think this is about the only other ethnic Nova Scotia-type poem that I've got, but I was only there for about six months and I can't quite put out a book yet. This is called \"By the Grey Atlantic\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:23:04\nReads \"By the Grey Atlantic\" [published later in The Cave and in The Fat Man].\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:23:31\nI think I'll read quickly a number of poems from this book. I'm anxious not to keep you too long, if anybody feels like walking out, I won't really be insulted if you'll [unintelligible]. These are all quite simple so I might as well just give the title in my school-class fashion and then go on to read them. This is called \"The Photograph my Mother Keeps\". I might see first that Veregin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7921203] is a town in Saskatchewan named after a leader of the Doukhobors [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5302215], they first came to that area after Peter the Lordly Verigin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4107818] [unintelligible] his palace, which is really just a gigantic farmhouse, it's outside the town. \n \nJohn Newlove\n00:24:19\nReads \"The Photograph my Mother Keeps\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:25:04\nThis one, about a pregnant girl, it's called \"On Her Long Bed of Night\u201d.\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:25:09\nReads \"On Her Long Bed of Night\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:26:12\nSo, this one's about my father. Drowning kittens, in a lot of houses in Saskatchewan you keep a rain barrel on a corner of the house underneath a spout to get the fresh rainwater for washing and so on.\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:26:27\nReads \u201cMy Daddy Drowned\u201d [from Elephants, Mothers and Others and later published in The Fat Man].\n \nAudience\n00:27:09.11\nLaughter and applause.\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:27:18\nThis one is called \"Half in Love\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:27:22\nReads \"Half in Love\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:28:02\nThis one is called \"Sister Cowen\". She used to run a mission in Edmonton [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2096], and she had very good stew. She was a very violent woman. On Christmas Eve she used to give all the bums fifty cents, but she gave a particularly long sermon on Christmas Eve. She was very down on booze.\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:28:25\nReads \"Sister Cowen\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:28:40\nLaughter.\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:28:49\nThis one is set in Vancouver outside Roy Kiyooka's studio. \n \nJohn Newlove\n00:28:58\nReads unnamed poem.\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:29:30\nThe name of this book is Elephants, Mothers, and Others. I've read poems about others and one about my mother, and this is the elephant\u2019s poem. \n \nJohn Newlove\n00:29:41\nReads \u201cElephants\u201d from Elephants, Mothers, and Others [and published later in The Fat Man; audience laughter throughout].\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:30:01\nI think I've gone on too long, there is a longish poem called \"The Fat Man\", which I want to read, so I'll skip the rest of the stuff I thought I was going to read and just do this one.\n \nAnnotation\n00:30:18\nReads \"The Fat Man\" [published later in The Fat Man].\n \nAudience\n00:34:47\nApplause.\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:34:48\nIt's not finished, you see, it's not...[Audience laughter].\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:34:52\nResumes reading \"The Fat Man\" [published later in The Fat Man].\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:36:33\nThank you.\n \nAudience\n00:36:35\nApplause.\n \nEND\n00:36:55\n"

                "notes": "Poet and artist Joe (Joseph) Rosenblatt was born in Toronto in 1933, where he attended Central Technical School, which he left in grade ten. After a decade of traveling across Canada, working labour jobs with the CPR, Rosenblatt published his first collection of poetry through a small press, called The voyage of the mood (Heinrich Heine Press, 1963). He received a Canada Council grant in 1963 to write and draw, and published The LSD Leacock (Coach House Press, 1966), which established Rosenblatt as a serious poet. Rosenblatt then began editing Jewish Dialog, a literary magazine, in 1969, which he continued until 1983. He then published The winter of the lunar moth (House of Anansi, 1968), a collection of drawings Greenbaum (Coach House Press, 1971), Bumblebee dithyramb (Press Porcepic, 1972), Dream craters (Press Porcepic, 1974), Virgins and vampires (McClelland and Stewart, 1975) and Top Soil (Press Porcepic, 1976) which won a Governor General\u2019s Award. Rosenblatt continued to publish collections of drawings and poetry collections, including Doctor Anacoda\u2019s solar fan club (Press Porcepic, 1978), Loosely tied hands: an experiment in punk (Black Moss Press, 1978), The sleeping lady (Exile Editions, 1979), Brides of the stream (Oolichan Books, 1983), a reconsidered history of Marxist government Beds and consenting dreamers (Oolichan Books, 1994) and The Joe Rosenblatt Reader (Exile Editions, 1995). Rosenblatt received the B.C. Book Prize in 1986 for Poetry Hotel (1986). Rosenblatt held several positions as writer in residence at the University of Western Ontario (1979-1980), as Visiting Lecturer at University of Victoria (1980-81), the Associate editor of the Malahat Review (1980-1982), the writer in residence at the Saskatoon Public Library (1985-86) and at the University of Rome and University of Bologna (1987). Rosenblatt also served as a literary consultant for Porcupine's Quill, Blackfish Press, McClelland and Stewart, the Canada Council and Oolichan Books.

[Audience laughter]. Well, welcome to the sixth reading of our second series of evenings with Canadian and American poets. Tonight we have Joe Rosenblatt [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1691575], Toronto [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q172], and John Newlove [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6250356], formerly of Vancouver [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q24639], now residing in Nova Scotia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1952]. Joe Rosenblatt will begin the reading, there will be an intermission, and John Newlove will follow. I'm going to quote largely from the copy in Joe Rosenblatt's book, The LSD Leacock, for I hope servient biographical information. It goes like this, he was born in Toronto on December the 26th, nineteen hundred and thirty-three. He says that he has suffocated in Toronto ever since then. He attended the Central Technical School [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5061898] and dropped out in Grade 10, he has worked as a grave-digger, plumber's helper, civil servant, railway express misanthrope. He has attended the Provincial Institute of Trades where he acquired a diploma as a welder fitter, his favourite writers are Ambrose Biers, William Blake [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q41513], Emily Dickinson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4441], and A.M. Klein [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2778027], and his favourite dream, is Cyclops turning up at a [nigh-bank (?)]. [Audience laughter]. His previous book of poems, which was probably printed in nineteen hundred and sixty-three, is called Voyage of the Mood. Joe Rosenblatt.\n \nAudience\n00:02:27\nApplause.\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:02:36\nWasn't that [unintelligible]. I'm just going to read, start off with a series of poems I had written about my uncle, who was a fishmonger. He had a habit of phyxiating and murdering fish, and slicing them, and slicing them, and...well, I'll start. This is called \"Uncle Nathan: Blessed his memory, speaketh in land-locked green\".\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:03:11\nReads \"Uncle Nathan: Blessed his memory, speaketh in land-locked green\" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].\n\nAudience\n00:06:10\nApplause.\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:06:16\n\"Ichthycide\". Another poem about my uncle. It's funny, really. [Audience laughter].\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:06:29\nReads \"Ichthycide\" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].\n \nAudience\n00:08:05\nLaughter and applause .\n\nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:08:13\nThis is called \"A Shell Game\". Has to do with my uncle. [Audience laughter]. It's about his funeral.  Joke.\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:08:27\nReads \"A Shell Game [from Winter of the Luna Moth].\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:09:42\nI wrote all kinds of poems. I was in Vancouver and I came across the god-awful logic of the zoo. It kinda scared the hell out of me. It was a bat. I've never seen a bat before. Met people who were bats. But this was the real McCoy, it was a fruit bat and it was hanging upside-down, you know, that's the way they live and they fornicate that way too, apparently, upside-down. So I wrote about bats. I have some more fish poems but I get tired of that after a while, you start hating it. And we'll begin with \"Bats\". While it's true the bat is a mammal, not a bird, there's all types of kinds of mythology based on prejudice about bats and which I've tried to embody in these poems. \n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:10:47\nReads \"Bats\" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:11:32\nOutside of the bat poem there came a group of sound poetry. Because I tried to get the feeling of the bat in the air, you know the image of the bat and the way it, and the movements of the bat. And this is called \"The Fruit Bat\". First encounter with a bat.\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:11:56\nReads \"The Fruit Bat\" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:13:16\nThis is better. This is \u201cThe Bat Cage\u201d.\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:13:19\nReads \u201cThe Bat Cage\u201d [from Winter of the Luna Moth]. \n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:14:39\nOh we're like bats to people. We used to have, I used to, when I was a kid I went to school and we had a music teacher who was a bit of a nut. She used to rap kids across the knuckles, you know, just to hear them singing. [Audience laughter]. I may have called her Mrs. Love, I can't recall, the trauma was too great. \n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:15:02\nReads \u201cThe Vampire\u201d [from Winter of the Luna Moth].\n \nAudience\n00:15:48\nLaughter and applause.\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:15:55\n\"The Zombie\". Just whistle when you get tired of these bat poems. Do anything you wanna do. \"The Zombie\". By the way, bats are supposed to be unkosher according to Leviticus [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q41490]. It says all fowl that creep going upon all fours shall be an abomination unto you. But in other countries they're great appetizers, the fruit bat especially, and I have an interesting poem, not right now though. \"The Zombie\".\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:16:26\nReads \"The Zombie\" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:17:59\nI'll read one more bat poem, it's the sound thing, an experimental thing which I later developed...too many of these bats here. I wrote a Christmas poem on bats, too. Maybe I should read it. Dedicated to somebody. I'll read the sound poem. It's more important. \"The Butterfly Bat\". There is a butterfly bat. Hm, found in the Orient, a very beautiful bat, orange apparently, very beautiful though. \n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:18:43\nReads \"The Butterfly Bat\" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:20:02\nReads \"Orpheus in Stanley Park\" [from Winter of the Luna Moth]. \n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:20:50\n\"Sex and Death\". This poem's for a friend of mine. \n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:20:54\nReads \"Sex and Death\" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:21:48\nI should read the egg poems, because I don't think many of you have heard them, and I'll do that. You'd probably like them better than the bats. More meaningful. This is called \"Egg Sonata\".\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:22:20\nReads \"Egg Sonata\" [from The LSD Leacock].\n \nAudience\n00:23:38\nLaughter and applause.\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:23:44\nReads [\"Let the egg live\" (?)].\n \nUnknown\n00:24:56\nSilence [cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:24:59\nReads \"It's in the egg, in the little round egg\" [from The LSD Leacock].\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:26:57\nOne more egg poem. [Audience laughter and applause]. This is a prose poem. It's called \"The Easter I got for Passover\". [Audience laughter]. It has to do with an argument, whether the body of Christ did not go to heaven, the moderator of the United Church of Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q198745] said yesterday, Right Reverend Ernest Marshall Howes told a press conference that he does not believe in the physical resurrection of Jesus but does believe in a spiritual resurrection. That's from the Globe and Mail [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q43148750], 23rd of April, '65.\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:27:46\nReads \"The Easter I got for Passover\" [from The LSD Leacock].\n \nAudience\n00:30:02\nApplause. \n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:30:10\nDo you want to read, John? Where is he? [Audience laughter]. Do you want me to come here? Yeah, okay. I'm getting down to my dirty poems, what am I going to do? I wrote a whole bunch of pornographic poetry, right. I'll read that for the end when the time's up. I wrote a poem to Che Guevara [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5809], if I can find the thing now, because I really muddled everything up here, oh here it is. It's called \"The Beehive: An Elegy to Che Guevara\".\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:30:52\nReads \"The Beehive: An Elegy to Che Guevara\" [from Winter of the Luna Moth]. \n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:31:42\nA poem about a critic, \u201cFable\u201d.\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:31:47\nReads \u201cFable\u201d [from Winter of the Luna Moth].  \n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:32:37\nI wrote another one about a critic, a friend of mine. It's called \"The Crab Louse\". I'll read it. [Audience laughter]. I think some of you may recognize him. \n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:32:47\nReads \"The Crab Louse\".\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:33:25\nReads \"The Fire Bug Poet\".\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:34:29\n\"How Mice Make Love,\" how'd this get in here? \"How Mice Make Love\".\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:34:36\nReads \"How Mice Make Love\" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:35:29\n\"The Electric Rose\".\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:35:34\nReads \"The Electric Rose\" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].\n \nAudience\n00:37:13\nApplause.\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:37:17\nShould I read on? Well this is a poem called \"Itch\". It's about that cat who, you know, in the world of the dead. And as usual I mucked up all the mythology, but it was too late to change the poem. So I said, what the hell. \n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:37:44\nReads \"Itch\" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:41:51\nThere's a loathsome typographical error in here. That's what happens.\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:41:56\nResumes reading \"Itch\" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:43:20\n[Unintelligible] a more cheerful poem, if I can find one here. How about \"Cricket Love\"? I'll read one very early poem I wrote, \"Better She Dressed in a Black Garment\". \n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:43:39\nReads \"Better She Dressed in a Black Garment\" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].\n \nJoe Rosenblatt\n00:44:21\nThank you. \n \nAudience\n00:44:22\nApplause.\n \nRoy Kiyooka\n00:44:35\nThere'll be a fifteen minute inter- [cut off abruptly]. \n \nEND\n00:44:37\n",

                "contents": "john_newlove_i006-11-143.mp3 [File 2 of 2]\n\nRoy Kiyooka\n00:00:00\nWell, it gives me a very special kind of pleasure to introduce John Newlove. An old and dear friend. We met in the fall of '61 in Vancouver, and both of us had come from Saskatchewan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1989] to Vancouver. I think that some of John's most memorable early poems have to do with the fact of Saskatchewan.  It's perhaps not an exaggeration to say that the place does continue to haunt him, and hopefully that the exorcism is not complete and that we may get some more Saskatchewan poems. Subsequently, and this is still in Vancouver, we shared a studio, or rather, he shared my studio [audience laughter], for a period of little over a year. Now during this time, we played marathon games of chess, ate several hundred dozens of chocolate-coated Long Johns, scribbled poems, dribbled paint, drank cheap red wine...and read through at least a dozen five-foot shelves of great and lesser works of literature, not to mention the confusion of mice, drunken poets, women, painters, and assorted kooks who kept visiting us. Now, it was during this period that his first book, called Grave Sirs was printed, and I have in italics here \"more or less.\" If you want to know the history of that book, you can ask John. I think there must be fifty odd copies that are still unbound someplace. This was printed by Robert Reed. It was followed by a second, called Elephants, Mothers, and Others, done by Tak Tanabe, again in Vancouver, and subsequent to that, it was rumored that Robert Columbo had discovered John Newlove for Canadian poetry [audience laughter], when he collected some of his works together in an anthology called Poetry '64. Now. Following this, of course, Contact Press bought out his book, Moving in Alone, which was perhaps the book that brought him his first large-scale critical attention. Meanwhile, of course, I'd come here, and some time afterwards I received a book, a wee book, called...let's see. [Audience laughter]. Can't read my own printing here. What They Say. Yes, What They Say is a wee book of poems, it's made up of the rejects from his manuscript that he submitted to McClelland and Stewart [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6800322]. McClelland and Stewart is to bring out his next book of poems called Black Night Window, when they get around to doing it. The manuscript has been in their hands for over twenty-four months. There has been much other activity which include three, two years and a third one coming up as poet in residence at Deep Springs [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5250324] in California [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q99]. I want to conclude this little preamble by saying that at the time that John moved out of our studio, I took over this room that he slept in and wrote poetry in. The mattress in this room was about sixteen inches from the floor, and on two sides, on the wall, there was copious scribbling.  Most of it were quotations from Heraclitus [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q41155] that he was reading at that time.\n \nAudience\n00:04:43\nApplause.\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:04:51\nThey weren't quotations from whoever, whatever Greek name that was you just made up, [audience laughter], they were from Herodotus [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q26825]. And, Roy [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3445789] might have mentioned that, while I suppose technically you could say I was sharing the studio, I was paying half the rent.  Almost half the rent. I was paying some rent. [Audience laughter]. And he never mentioned who won most of the chess games. I write a lot of...who's throwing things at me?  You didn't win any chess games. [Audience laughter]. And you weren't paying any rent, either. I write a lot of poems about dreams, one night I woke up with a dream about an Australian chief and I managed to write down most of it. It's called \"The Almost King\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:05:42\nReads \"The Almost King\" [audience laughter throughout].\n\nJohn Newlove\n00:08:32\nWell, when you have dreams like that, you don't really have much chance. I've a number of short poems, I'm told it's not good to give them at poetry readings because people don't listen fast enough or something. But. [Laughter]. This...Yes, that ashtray is stolen from the faculty club, George, and your wife stole it. [Audience laughter]. This one is called \"The Candle\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:09:07\nReads \"The Candle\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:09:19\nAgain a dream. This poem, misprinted in the Malahat Review [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1567225], is one that I most like. It's called \"The Engine and the Sea\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:09:32\nReads \"The Engine and the Sea\" [published later in The Cave and in The Fat Man].\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:11:26\nLove poems about sleep. And about dreams. This one is called \"Before Sleep\". I used to have a great deal of trouble going to sleep because I was afraid I would have nightmares.\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:11:44\nReads \"Before Sleep\" [later published in The Cave and in The Fat Man].\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:12:53\nAnd again another one about dreams, this one called \"The Dream Man\u201d. Dreamed I once wrote a dream about somebody else's dream, but that's not fair, dreams are copyright. This was my own. [Audience laughter].\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:13:09\nReads \"The Dream Man\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:14:35\nAccording to the rules, you're supposed to say things in between poems, but I can't really ever think of anything appropriate to say in between them, so. I used to have some nice Ed Sullivan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q83807] routines, but I've forgotten them. This poem is called \"Burn\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:14:52\nReads \"Burn\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:15:16\nAnd this one, an old one, again fairly short. It's called \"No Song\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:15:25\nReads \"No Song\" [from Black Night Window and published later in The Fat Man].\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:15:47\nI have a poem I wrote for and about a friend, but after the poem was finished as you may see, I showed it to him but I didn't tell him it was about him. He said it was a very good poem and very accurate, and so on. But he didn't know it was about himself. It's called, \"What do you want, what do you want?\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:16:06\nReads \"What do you want, what do you want?\" [from Black Night Window and later published in The Fat Man; audience laughter and applause throughout].\n  \nJohn Newlove\n00:17:01\nAfter he said it was such an accurate poem, I couldn't tell him it was about him. This one's called \"Strand by Strand\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:17:14\nReads \"Strand by Strand\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:17:56\nThis is the first time I've kept to a list of...because usually I decide that I don't want to read a particular poem and I get all confused, but I'm very pleased with myself when I keep right to the schedule. Everything organized, everything complete. This short poem in five naturally short pieces is called \"One Day\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:18:23\nReads \"One Day\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:18:55\nCharles Williams [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q124735] died in about 1953, he was an Englishman, originally Cockney. He wrote a number of what I think are very good poems, a number of detective novels, some theological deputation, I guess would be the right word. One of his detective novels is about finding the holy grail. It's called War in Heaven and it's out in Faber Paperback, go and buy it, it's really nice. This poem is for and from and about Charles Williams.\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:19:35\nReads \u201cFor and From Charles Williams\u201d [from What They Say].\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:20:04\nNow my list has gone to pot, because I've got a poem down in a magazine that I didn't bring. So. One day some years ago, I was hitchhiking out to British Columbia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1974]. I got to a place called Golden [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1020179], B.C. and I had to go up the Big Bend Highway [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30253222], this would be before the Rogers Pass [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q383051] was open. And I got a ride about thirty miles in on what I didn't know was an illegally-present logging truck, because the Big Bend Highway was not open to traffic for three more days. So I sat three days on the Big Bend Highway. This poem roughly...well, it's called \"Solitaire\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:20:47\nReads \"Solitaire\" [from Black Night Window and published later in The Fat Man].\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:21:22\nThis short one called \"El Paso\" because El Paso was the place where it happens. It was ninety degrees outside in El Paso [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16562], and with the air conditioning, which I couldn't turn off, it was about thirty below. And I couldn't sleep, I had to get up in the middle of the night and get dressed and get under the blankets, and I caught terrible cold in that motel. \n \nJohn Newlove\n00:21:41\nReads \"El Paso\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:21:56\nSince I've been out of Nova Scotia, I've written a couple of poems about or around Nova Scotia. The main thing I can't seem to get in a poem just yet is the difference between the Pacific Ocean [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q98], in Vancouver, and the Atlantic [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q97]. There seems a tremendous difference that I can feel but that I can't seem yet to grasp in the fact. This poem is called \"God Bless You\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:22:24\nReads \"God Bless You\" [later published in The Cave and in The Fat Man].\n \nAudience\n00:22:43\nLaughter.\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:22:47\nThe next piece is on the back of my list. I think this is about the only other ethnic Nova Scotia-type poem that I've got, but I was only there for about six months and I can't quite put out a book yet. This is called \"By the Grey Atlantic\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:23:04\nReads \"By the Grey Atlantic\" [published later in The Cave and in The Fat Man].\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:23:31\nI think I'll read quickly a number of poems from this book. I'm anxious not to keep you too long, if anybody feels like walking out, I won't really be insulted if you'll [unintelligible]. These are all quite simple so I might as well just give the title in my school-class fashion and then go on to read them. This is called \"The Photograph my Mother Keeps\". I might see first that Veregin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7921203] is a town in Saskatchewan named after a leader of the Doukhobors [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5302215], they first came to that area after Peter the Lordly Verigin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4107818] [unintelligible] his palace, which is really just a gigantic farmhouse, it's outside the town. \n \nJohn Newlove\n00:24:19\nReads \"The Photograph my Mother Keeps\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:25:04\nThis one, about a pregnant girl, it's called \"On Her Long Bed of Night\u201d.\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:25:09\nReads \"On Her Long Bed of Night\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:26:12\nSo, this one's about my father. Drowning kittens, in a lot of houses in Saskatchewan you keep a rain barrel on a corner of the house underneath a spout to get the fresh rainwater for washing and so on.\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:26:27\nReads \u201cMy Daddy Drowned\u201d [from Elephants, Mothers and Others and later published in The Fat Man].\n \nAudience\n00:27:09.11\nLaughter and applause.\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:27:18\nThis one is called \"Half in Love\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:27:22\nReads \"Half in Love\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:28:02\nThis one is called \"Sister Cowen\". She used to run a mission in Edmonton [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2096], and she had very good stew. She was a very violent woman. On Christmas Eve she used to give all the bums fifty cents, but she gave a particularly long sermon on Christmas Eve. She was very down on booze.\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:28:25\nReads \"Sister Cowen\".\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:28:40\nLaughter.\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:28:49\nThis one is set in Vancouver outside Roy Kiyooka's studio. \n \nJohn Newlove\n00:28:58\nReads unnamed poem.\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:29:30\nThe name of this book is Elephants, Mothers, and Others. I've read poems about others and one about my mother, and this is the elephant\u2019s poem. \n \nJohn Newlove\n00:29:41\nReads \u201cElephants\u201d from Elephants, Mothers, and Others [and published later in The Fat Man; audience laughter throughout].\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:30:01\nI think I've gone on too long, there is a longish poem called \"The Fat Man\", which I want to read, so I'll skip the rest of the stuff I thought I was going to read and just do this one.\n \nAnnotation\n00:30:18\nReads \"The Fat Man\" [published later in The Fat Man].\n \nAudience\n00:34:47\nApplause.\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:34:48\nIt's not finished, you see, it's not...[Audience laughter].\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:34:52\nResumes reading \"The Fat Man\" [published later in The Fat Man].\n \nJohn Newlove\n00:36:33\nThank you.\n \nAudience\n00:36:35\nApplause.\n \nEND\n00:36:55\n",

Sadly enough, as he tells me, the only book of his still generally in print is the Selected Poems of 1966, which we do have on sale outside the door and of which, I should remind you, he gets a cut from his publisher.

Luckily there, I have, have heard that there will be a couple of Birney books within the next little while, one of them published in the United States [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30] and the other one by the Coach House Press [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5137585], presuming always that there will be a Coach House Press in the next little while. I would just like to mention that my association with Earle Birney has always been very, a good one, for me, and I wouldn't be here today to be talking about him unless I happened to be a member of the Poetry Committee, and, except that if it hadn't been for him, and the fact that both he and I were in Vancouver [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q24639] at one time, I probably wouldn't have been writing any poems at all. Either that, or he would be writing mine. So without any further ado, and probably to our great delectation, I would like to introduce Earle Birney. \n \nAudience\n00:02:15 \nApplause.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:02:26\nThank you very much, George [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1239280]. I should, in all fairness to George, say that he actually wrote all this information about me and probably a good number of the poems, which I will be reading under my own name tonight. I would also like to say that I have, was recently corresponding with a man who had just resigned as president of a University to become a Dean of another University and had said, well, at least I will show them that if a Dean is a mouse in training to be a rat, then some rats can revert to being mice. Now, if we apply this to the world of poetry, I would say that I am a mouse in training to be less than a mouse, to be something in another category--I think I'd like to be Bursar of Canadian Poetry. But nobody has really set me up for that. I'm going to start by making sure that I read one good poem tonight by reading a poem of W. B. Yeats [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q40213] [audience laughter] called \"A Prayer for Old Age\", which has, I think, I'm afraid, more and more pertinence to my condition. He wrote it at 69. \n \nEarle Birney\n00:04:10\nReads \"A Prayer for Old Age\"  by W. B. Yeats.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:04:54\nThat I will use as an excuse for some of the poems I now shall read you, if I can find my list. The last thing. Ah yes, here it is. Now there's no mic and I want to make sure that everyone is hearing me. If I'm not talking loud enough, those that cannot hear, would you please put a hand up now. I'm very sorry, I'm very sorry--well, you will have to go to the back and then somebody who's standing can come here. I'm sorry there aren't, that some of you have to stand, and I'll try to make it as fast as possible so we can all get out of here. [Audience laughter]. I'm going to begin with some poems that are, alas, too well known to my fellow poets, most of them in this room, but I had planned it this way and I'm stuck with it now and so are they. I'm going to begin with a series that came out, some members of a series that came out in Ice Cod Bell or Stone, and later others in, Near False Creek Mouth, that have to do with wandering around the global village, and this one begins in, well it since begins in Vancouver, but it's about Honolulu [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q18094]. I got a fellowship to go to England [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q21] and I was in Vancouver and I discovered that it only cost me two hundred dollars and some odd cents more to go to London [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q84] and back to Vancouver by way of going around the world, you know, just heading west. The air tickets were accommodating me that way. So I decided to go west, and my first stop, I noticed, was Honolulu, and I began to get a bit of a temperature about that, and I thought, how 'bout, I might as well live it up, I'm going to Honolulu tomorrow morning, going to be there tomorrow night, and so I will engage a room in Hawaiian Village Hotel for the one night, because first night, I know I have a little money. After that, God knows what's going to happen to me because I intend to stay in a lot of places before I get to London. So I did this, I reserved a room before I left Vancouver, not realizing that this had put me in a bit of a box, because this is one of the Kaiser-Hilton hotels on Waikiki Beach [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q254861], and they have a special greeter who meets all the planes, just for people coming to them. And it happened, through another mischance, that I was the only one for that hotel, and this unsettled me so much I had to write about it. [Audience laughter]. Something which I call \"Twenty-Third Flight\" for reasons, well, the poem is imitative of another poet, much older, much greater, by the name of David. Not the one that I pushed off the cliff [audience laughter], the one who was a harpist.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:08:39\nReads \"Twenty-Third Flight\" [from Selected Poems 1940-1966; audience laughter throughout].\n \nAudience\n00:10:58\nApplause and laughter.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:11:06\nThank you very much, I hesitate to look as if I anticipated more applause, but I would much prefer it if you'd just let me rattle ahead here, for one thing it's getting hotter in here and more and more uncomfortable and as I say, let me get ahead with it, and so if at the end, of course, if anybody is still here with enough energy left, fine. Is there anybody who knows where water is available, any water hole out there in those vast cement deserts?\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:11:50\nThere should be some beside you, there.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:11:52\nUh, well, there's a water pitcher, and a water glass\u2026[audience laughter]. I'll prove it... [audience laughter].\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:12:05\nIf I drink it, it's okay.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:12:06\nYeah! ...Well, while George is away I'll read one of his poems. This one is called \"Honolulu\" and follows immediately after the other, but in between was about forty, twenty-four hours, I guess, in which I visited the very famous outdoor aviary, one of the world's famous aviaries, and also the aquarium and so on, and I also encountered a type, a Honolulu type of sorts. So this poem, which is perhaps about the involvement of people with animals through self-projection, and the involvement of human animals with each other. \n \nEarle Birney\n00:13:05\nReads \"Honolulu\" [from Selected Poems 1940-1966].\n \nEarle Birney\n00:14:41\nThen I went to Japan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q17], and I want to read you one little poem, this is my Zen poem, I guess. [Audience laughter]. Every poet has to have a Zen poem. Thank you, George. \n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:14:54\nOh ho, I could give you a Zen greeting. Alright. It's really cold. I tried to get it out of the Coke [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2813] machine but it just didn't work. \n \nEarle Birney\n00:15:03\nGood gin, thank you. \"Windchimes in a Temple Ruin\"--you know these little glass-leave things, which one expects to see in Japan, but not suddenly to hear when you're all alone in an old ruin. Some left up in the rafters.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:15:31\nReads \"Windchimes in a Temple Ruin\" [from Selected Poems 1940-1966].\n \nEarle Birney\n00:16:12\nBut I think I'm going to leave Asia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q48] for the moment, and get on to Europe [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q46], briefly, been around to Spain [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q29], at any rate. I was sitting, more or less minding my own business, on a plaza in Madrid [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2807] one morning, having my coffee, and something happened, which again I felt I should chronicle. Desmond Pacey [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5264782] says I'm a chronicler, and so I, having learned that, I now use the word [audience laughter] to explain what I'm doing. I renamed the plaza, it had a rather dull name, I call it Plaza de Inquisicion. \n \nEarle Birney\n00:17:09\nReads \u201cPlaza de Inquisicion\u201d [from Near False Creek Mouth and collected in Selected Poems 1940-1966].\n \nEarle Birney\n00:17:44\nI also went to the Prado [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q160112] of course, and saw, for the first time, the original of one of the three studies by El Greco [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q301] of The Espolio [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q52301456], or the taking-off and rending of Christ's garments, which was one of El Greco's themes. And I was struck, as I had never been really before, I suppose because I never had really looked at these paintings properly, I had looked at them in small illustrations--I was struck by the extraordinary amount of space which had been taken up, which El Greco had devoted to the carpenter who was making the holes in the cross preparatory to having Christ nailed to the cross. In fact, the whole lower third of the canvas is devoted to him in one of these three versions, and not only that but he is, they're facing us, with his back to Christ, and on the right and left are two of the Marys, whose eyes are on him. I felt that perhaps El Greco was trying to say something here, apart from what he was saying about the actual scene of the crucifixion, in a symbolic way, perhaps about something that happened to do, really, with this religion, but with, whatever we'd call it, religion, whatever we'd call it, of art. Or if not of art, but craft. It's a little, perhaps, exaggerated, to call the carpenter an artist, but it's obvious that he'd been very much at that moment a craftsman. And so I wrote \"El Greco: Espolio\".\n \nEarle Birney\n00:20:04\nReads \"El Greco: Espolio\" [from Selected Poems 1940-1966].\n \nEarle Birney\n00:22:29\nWhen I come to Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16], now, I'm going to kind of sneak in on the side by reading you a poem that has to do with a very remote, I suppose the most remote part of Canada, in fact, the piece of land that is even nearer to the North Pole [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q934] than Greenland [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q223] or anything the Russians have, Ellesmereland [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q146841]. And I will read it first of all in English, and then, more or less for the hell of it, I'm going to read it in a translation into Spanish, but anyway, because I think I like the sound of it in Spanish. It's short, so I've practiced my Spanish on it, and maybe I won't make too many boobs.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:23:30\nReads \"Ellesmereland\" in English [published later in The Collected Poems of Earle Birney, Vol 1].\n \nEarle Birney\n00:24:10\nReads \"Ellesmereland\" in Spanish.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:24:59\nWell I'll get down and turn to more familiar territory. \"Canada Case History\". This is a poem written quite a long time ago, in 1945, in fact, when I'd just got back from World War Number Two [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q362], I always have to be careful to name which one it is, people getting confused about how far back I go now. And I found that in 1967 I had to do a little patching and changing of this, because history had not only caught up with me, it had changed me. But here, first of all is the original. No, I don't think, I can't, I don't think I can bear to read the original, I think I'll just read you what, what happened to this poem in 1967 in the centennial year.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:26:09\nReads \"Canada: Case History\" [from Selected Poems 1940-1966; audience laughter throughout].\n \nEarle Birney\n00:28:15\nWell now I'm going to read you other various scrappy things about Canadian literature which have never been published and never will be, I think, sneak them out like this once in a while. \n \nEarle Birney\n00:28:38\nReads unnamed poem.\n \nAudience \n00:29:20\nLaughter.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:29:29\nThen there's John, Jean Cabot, as I think my school teacher, trying very hard to be bilingual, made us say, but it turns out he wasn't French at all, but Italian. His name was Giovanni Caboto [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q85642]. \n \nEarle Birney\n00:29:48\nReads \"John Cabot\" [published later as \u201cgiovanni caboto - john cabot\u201d in Rag & Bone Shop].\n \nAudience\n00:30:27\nLaughter.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:30:36\nThis is something to my publisher, when they brought out a book of mine, Ice Cod Bell or Stone, full of beautiful artwork, except that the man in charge of the artwork had never read the little poem, the \"Klein Ellesmereland\" that I've just read to you, and so never discovered that when I was talking about bells, I was talking about harebells, or flowers, and he put very large iron church bells into all the illustrations. [Audience laughter]. I had asked to see the artwork in advance and was told that the authors, that this was not the custom to show authors the artwork in advance, so I didn't see it. So all I could do at the end was write something. \"To the reader\u201d, which was not included in the volume.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:31:45\nReads \"To the reader\".\n \nEarle Birney\n00:32:39\nI went to spend a weekend a couple of years ago for the first time with Al Purdy [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4704621] in his shack in Ameliasburg [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4742321], and I had read a lot of his Ameliasburg poems before, and I knew Al, but this was a new experience to be actually in the country of the poet, particularly as it was so well staked out--nobody else has ever written about Ameliasburg and the country north of there. Or ever will, I think. But Al has used it, and the country, and developed it into part of the remarkable fineness of his poetry. \n \nEarle Birney\n00:33:33\nReads \"In Purdy's Ameliasburg\" [published later in Rag & Bone Shop]. \n \nEarle Birney\n00:37:13\nNow a poem about another part of Canada. Still Ontario [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1904], part of the north. This is a poem about driving west with somebody else, another guy, and...well there it is. It's called \"Way to the West\". Summertime.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:37:46\nReads \"Way to the West\" [from Selected Poems 1940-1966].\n \nEarle Birney\n00:41:45\nWell, I'm going to get out to the West Coast very briefly. I'm going to read you something toward the end of a long poem. The trouble with long poems is, you could never dare to read the whole thing to any audience. So I'll read you, it's toward the end of the thing called \"November walk near False Creek mouth\". The last page.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:42:26\nReads final section of \"November walk near False Creek mouth\" [from Near False Creek Mouth and collected later in Selected Poems 1940-1966].\n \nEND\n00:45:06\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n \nEarle Birney\n00:45:07\nI'm going to read you a few odd things which are to some extent experimental, I suppose. Most of these have not been published, and some of them I haven't read before. This one is called a \"Swahili Serenade\" and I'll tell you about it after I read it. It's Swahili Found Serenade, really. \n \nEarle Birney\n00:45:44\nReads \"Swahili Serenade\" [published later as \u201cfound swahili serenade\u201d in Rag & Bone Shop; audience laughter throughout].\n \nEarle Birney\n00:46:13\nWell, as some of you have already perceived, already noticed, this is made up, each line is a juke-box tune, it's just a very easy kind of poem to make up; I offer it to you as a formula for quick poetry, just sit down by a jukebox and pick off some titles. [Audience laughter]. Five minute poem. Here's another kind of found poem of a different sort, called, I call it \"Space Conquest\". That's about all that I've contributed to it. \"Space Conquest\".\n \nEarle Birney\n00:46:56\nReads \"Space Conquest\".\n \nEarle Birney\n00:47:33\nWell those ten lines, each of five syllables, came out of a computer at the University of Waterloo [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1049470] last week, into which we had programmed a hundred and eleven, the one hundred and eleven words of George Meredith's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q90238] \"Lucifer in Starlight,\" and the last thirty-three words of Archibald MacLeish's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q633354] \"The End of the World.\" Don't ask me why we picked those two poems, I had nothing to do with the picking of the poems. But some of us, two linguists, two linguist-isists, a mathematician, and myself, and masses of computers are producing this sort of poetry. It took point eight-three seconds, not even one second, to produce the hundred-some-odd lines, out of which I chose those ten. So you can see it doesn't take very long, once you've programmed the machine, to find the, you know, the entire text of Hamlet [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q41567], but this is what we have done so far, we haven't put too much time on it yet. Some things that I haven't had computers write for me, although perhaps I might have, or should have. This one's called \"Kooks of the Monk\". \n \nEarle Birney\n00:49:24\nReads \"Kooks of the Monk\".\n \nAudience\n00:49:37\nLaughter.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:49:39\nThat is sometimes called \"concrete\". Fun anyway, to do. This is something that I may not be able to finish, but I'll try it. It's the train from Cardiff [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q10690] to London. English trains sound different, of course. \n \nEarle Birney\n00:50:03\nPerforms \"Train from Cardiff to London\".\n \nAudience\n00:50:53\nLaughter.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:50:59\nThis is a found collage from one issue of the Toronto Daily Star [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1067299], called \"Toronto Daily Tele-Starlings\", and this is only a small part of the poem which has no beginning or end, it goes on forever if you read the whole of the Star.  \n \nEarle Birney\n00:51:22\nReads \"Toronto Daily Tele-Starlings\" [audience laughter throughout].\n \nEarle Birney\n00:53:26\nA series of poems with reference back to the Yeats poem I read at the beginning, perhaps. \n \nEarle Birney\n00:53:36\nReads \"Like an eddy\" [published later in Rag & Bone Shop and collected in Ghost in the Wheels: Selected Poems].\n\nEarle Birney\n00:55:42\nAnd, two short haikus.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:55:47\nReads [two of three haikus from \u201chokkai in the dew line snow\u201d, published later in Rag & Bone Shop and collected in Ghost in the Wheels: Selected Poems].\n \nEarle Birney\n00:56:16\nReads [\"BUILDINGS\", published later in Rag & Bone Shop and collected in The Collected Poems of Earle Birney, Vol 1].\n \nEarle Birney\n00:56:50\nAnd, a poem that is written in kind of an attempt to write something to express a tiny little bit of the pleasure I've had, through most of my life, in reading Chaucer [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5683]. Called \"I'm always going back to Chaucer\".\n \nEarle Birney\n00:57:20\nReads \"I'm always going back to Chaucer\" in Middle English.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:59:06\nNow something that has to do with my Shetland [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q47134] grand-aunt. Tea with my Shetland grand-aunt. This is a little, slightly different dialect. And there's a kind of an opposition of styles going on here. It's a very old poem, refurbished.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:59:32\nReads \"Tea at my Shetland Aunt\u2019s\" in a Shetland dialect [published later in The Collected Poems of Earle Birney, Vol 1].\n\n \nEarle Birney\n01:01:21\nWell now I'm going to turn back to older poems. To conclude. Hum...I'm going to read two or three poems that, who have some relationship to California [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q99] and Oregon [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q824]. First of all, a poem that, when I wrote it, I wrote it on the day of its date. I thought the date was going to be very significant. August the seven, 1964, Florence [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q862740], Oregon. And that was because on that day, the American fleet moved into the coast and shelled the coast of North Vietnam [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q881], against the international agreements into which the United States had entered some years before. And I thought that this would surely go down in living memory, as a deed of aggression and perfidy. But there have been so many since, almost every day, that everybody has forgotten about that first shelling of the shore from the Gulf of Tonkin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q212428]. But I happened to be on the shore of the Pacific [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q98] almost directly across from the Gulf of Tonkin, in fact, the waves that were coming in perhaps had their pulsing first on the other side. And this, one couldn't get it out of one's mind, having seen the morning papers and heard the radio, and I went, I had gone fishing with an American poet and his two boys. The salmon were running, coming in, but I have got less and less interested in killing even fish as I get older and softer, and I soon gave up even wanting to cook fish, and left it to the others, and I went up, because I had nothing to do then, I went up and I sat on a cliff, and started thinking about the sea out there, and cormorants fishing, and once in a while the flash of a seal coming up, also fishing, and I also suddenly realized I was sitting there just staring out at the sea and I began to think, I remembered Frost's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q168728] poem about how odd human beings are, you know, they go down to the sea and they sit and they all, they always look out at the sea, although they can't look very far out or very far in. And I thought that was exactly what I was feeling, the whole thing. But I thought well it's not really Frost's ocean, this is Robinson Jeffers' [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q734955] ocean, and here is this great eye of indifference, so I began my poem, called \"Looking from Oregon\" with a line from Robinson Jeffers about the Pacific: \"And what it watches is not our wars\".\n \nEarle Birney\n01:04:54\nReads \"Looking from Oregon\" [from Selected Poems 1940-1966].\n \nEarle Birney\n01:06:20\nAnd another little poem which is really a video poem, and I should put it on a screen but I forgot to bring my slides. Brought them as far as the hotel, but I forgot to bring them up here.  o you'll just have to visualize a poem shaped like a pair of stairs but coming up at you, and visualize yourself at the top of these stairs with your back against the side of a theatre, a campus theatre at the University of Oregon [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q766145], with signs of last week's shows, this one to go on tonight, that I'm waiting to go into, waiting for my friends, who have the tickets, and watching people come up these steps, the cars coming by and discharging people. \"Campus Theatre Steps\". Summertime, a beautiful summer night. \n \nEarle Birney\n01:07:14\nReads \"Campus Theatre Steps\" [from Selected Poems 1940-1966].\n \nEarle Birney\n01:08:04\nThen I was driving along the coast, a long time, and I was confronted with a sign that hadn't been there before. A billboard, with the same message multiplied up and down the coast and everywhere I went, since the last time I was there. Now I, this is my favourite state of the American Union, Oregon, absolutely beautiful, still, despite whatever, all the attempts of man to un-beautify it, there's still this great volcanic, snow-covered mountains, such, shaped a bit like Fujiyama [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q39231], there is also all those beautiful rocks and sea-lion caves and the pounding surf and the rhododendrons, the whole works. And there's these, this sign saying, \"Billboards Build Freedom of Choice, Courtesy of Oregon Chamber of Commerce\". I brooded about this, and being alone, I couldn't get the answer. What is the philosophy behind this? So I invented a hitchhiker, and I picked him up, and he told me, and this is what he said. This poem is dated 61-62, and Khruschev [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q35314] is still in power in Russia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q159]. \n \nEarle Birney\n01:09:36\nReads \"Billboards Build Freedom of Choice\" [from Near False Creek Mouth and collected later in Selected Poems 1940-1966].\n \nEarle Birney\n01:11:42\nWell, I think we'll slip down into Mexico [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q96] for a moment before we wind this show up. There's a very short little thing called Irapuato [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q816845]. Well it's all part, it's like, poetry is like guidebooks, you know, guidebooks are always pointing out irrational connections between things, and so is poetry, so sometimes they get together, and in this case the guidebook had told me that there were two things, sort of, that this place was famous for, and I had discovered they were right.\n \nEarle Birney\n01:12:29\nReads \"Irapuato\" [from Selected Poems 1940-1966].\n \nEarle Birney\n01:13:06\nReads \"Memory No Servant\" [from Near False Creek Mouth and collected later in Selected Poems 1940-1966].\n \nEarle Birney\n01:14:20\nA poem addressed to friend and writer George Lamming [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1340511], who's perhaps best known for his autobiography of his child as a poor negro boy on the island of Barbados [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q244]. George Lamming who wrote In the Castle of My Skin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q23307454], and who happened to be in Jamaica [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q766] when I went there, and was extremely hospitable to me, and so were all his friends. And when I left I wrote him this poem, which had to do with a split-second feeling, something, thing happening inside me, an internal happening, the night of the last party, the last night of the last party. \n \nEarle Birney\n01:15:18\nReads \"For George Lamming\" [from Near False Creek Mouth and collected later in Selected Poems 1940-1966].\n \nEarle Birney\n01:16:32\nWell just in case you would think that I am soft about this and I'm going to like anybody if their skin is darker than mine, I'll read you a counter-poem that happened to come out of the island of Trinidad [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q128323], out of some little external happening, perhaps in part, perhaps really just an internal happening.\n \nEarle Birney\n01:17:20\nReads \"Meeting of Strangers\" [from Near False Creek Mouth and collected later in Selected Poems 1940-1966].\n \nEarle Birney\n01:19:06\nAnd then a very brief little, Irving Layton [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1673289]-type poem from Curacao [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q25279]. Very much a...very pallid compared with Irving's, I must say.\n \nEarle Birney\n01:19:22\nReads \"Curacao\" [from Near False Creek Mouth and collected later in Selected Poems 1940-1966].\n \nAudience\n01:19:45\nLaughter.\n \nEarle Birney\n01:19:54\nNow I'm going to conclude with two pieces. One is about the farthest back of these poems. Although some things I've read tonight began earlier but have been revised, this one has not been particularly revised. It's called \"The Road to Nijmegen\" and was written in Holland [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q55] in January of 1945, the last winter of the war. Which was the coldest winter, and in this part of Holland, first the Germans in coming and then in retreating had cut down every tree anywhere around. The trees were used for fuel and for mine props and...And then we had come in, and if there were any trees left, we'd got them. And in fact, it was no longer a matter of trees, it was a matter of trying to find bits and pieces of coal and getting the coal working and getting the coal out of the hands of black marketeers. And meantime the people were cold, even colder than we were, and they also lacked food. This is a letter home to a friend.\n \nEarle Birney\n01:22:10\nReads \"The Road to Nijmegen\" [published later in The Collected Poems of Earle Birney, Vol 1].\n \nEarle Birney\n01:24:38\nAnd finally, \u201cFrom The Hazel Bough\u201d.\n \nEarle Birney\n01:24:48\nReads \"From the Hazel Bough\" [from Selected Poems 1940-1966 and collected ater in The Collected Poems of Earle Birney, Vol 1].\n \nEarle Birney\n01:25:41\nThank you very much.\n \nAudience\n01:25:43\nApplause.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n01:26:12\nI guess you've already said it for us, and I can only repeat, thanks very much, Earle.\n \nEND\n01:26:25\n[Cut off abruptly]."

                "notes": "Poet Earle Birney was born in Calgary, Alberta in 1904, when it was still part of the Northwest Territories. Birney spent his early years on a remote farm, until his family moved to Banff in 1911, and then again in 1916 to Creston, British Columbia. Upon graduation from high-school, Birney worked odd jobs as a bank clerk, a farm labourer and as a general labourer at national parks in B.C. before enrolling at the University of British Columbia, in chemistry, in 1922. He quickly switched into english literature and became the associate editor and subsequently editor-in-chief of the school newspaper, The Ubyssey. Birney graduated in Honours English in 1926, and completed a Master\u2019s Degree from the University of Toronto in 1927. Birney pursued further graduate work at the University of California at Berkeley, until leaving in 1930 for the University of Utah to become a lecturer for two years. He returned to Toronto to complete his Ph.D. from the University of Toronto, and became a party organizer for the Trotskyist branch of the Communist Party. Birney received a fellowship to the University of London, England to study and thus traveled to Norway to interview Leon Trotsky. In 1938, with Ph.D. in hand, Birney taught at the University of Toronto and became the editor of the Canadian Forum until 1940. After enlisting in the Canadian Army, he published his first volume of poetry, David (Ryerson Press, 1942) which won the Governor General\u2019s Award for Poetry. Birney then shipped off to serve in the Second World War, returning with a manuscript for Now is time (Ryerson Press, 1945), which also won a Governor General\u2019s Award. Birney was editor of The Canadian Poetry Magazine (1946-48) and a professor at the University of British Columbia (1948-62). There, Birney created the very first department of creative writing in Canada. His subsequent publications include The strait of Anian (Ryerson Press, 1948), Trial of a city (Ryerson Press,1952) which was later published with its original title, The damnation of Vancouver (McClelland and Stewart, 1957), Ice cod bell or stone (McClelland and Stewart, 1962). Throughout the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s, his poetry became more innovative and radical, publishing Near false creek mouth (McClelland and Stewart, 1964), a collaboration with bp Nichol, Pnomes, jukollages & other stunzas (Ganglia Press, 1969), Rag and bone shop (McClelland and Stewart, 1971), What\u2019s so big about green? (McClelland and Stewart, 1973), The rugging and the moving times (Black Moss Press, 1976), Alphbeings and other seasyours (Pikadilly Press, 1976), and Fall by fury (McClelland and Stewart, 1978). Along with poetry, Birney published two prose novels, Turvey  (McClelland and Stewart, 1949) and Down the long table (McClelland and Stewart, 1955), a collection of stories Big bird in the bush (Mosaic Press, 1978), non fiction The creative writer (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, 1966), and The cow jumped over the moon (Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1972) among others. Birney\u2019s poems have been collected in Selected poems (McClelland and Stewart, 1966), The poems of Earle Birney (McClelland and Stewart, 1969), Collected poems (McClelland and Stewart, 1975), and his last volume, Last makings (McClelland and Stewart, 1991). Birney received an honorary doctorate from the University of Alberta and was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. Earle Birney died in 1995."

                "contents": "George Bowering\n00:00:00\nI think it's, it's either redundant or futile to do anything more than the formality of introducing Earle Birney [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3046415] who's probably the most famous poet we've ever had and who you will see described on those pieces of paper, pink that flit around, as always as a, the Dean of Canadian Poetry, though I prefer to think of him as the federal Minister for Poetry, and the times he has been a semi-official courier of Canadian poetry around the world. Sadly enough, as he tells me, the only book of his still generally in print is the Selected Poems of 1966, which we do have on sale outside the door and of which, I should remind you, he gets a cut from his publisher. [Audience laughter]. Luckily there, I have, have heard that there will be a couple of Birney books within the next little while, one of them published in the United States [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30] and the other one by the Coach House Press [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5137585], presuming always that there will be a Coach House Press in the next little while. I would just like to mention that my association with Earle Birney has always been very, a good one, for me, and I wouldn't be here today to be talking about him unless I happened to be a member of the Poetry Committee, and, except that if it hadn't been for him, and the fact that both he and I were in Vancouver [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q24639] at one time, I probably wouldn't have been writing any poems at all. Either that, or he would be writing mine. So without any further ado, and probably to our great delectation, I would like to introduce Earle Birney. \n \nAudience\n00:02:15 \nApplause.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:02:26\nThank you very much, George [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1239280]. I should, in all fairness to George, say that he actually wrote all this information about me and probably a good number of the poems, which I will be reading under my own name tonight. I would also like to say that I have, was recently corresponding with a man who had just resigned as president of a University to become a Dean of another University and had said, well, at least I will show them that if a Dean is a mouse in training to be a rat, then some rats can revert to being mice. Now, if we apply this to the world of poetry, I would say that I am a mouse in training to be less than a mouse, to be something in another category--I think I'd like to be Bursar of Canadian Poetry. But nobody has really set me up for that. I'm going to start by making sure that I read one good poem tonight by reading a poem of W. B. Yeats [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q40213] [audience laughter] called \"A Prayer for Old Age\", which has, I think, I'm afraid, more and more pertinence to my condition. He wrote it at 69. \n \nEarle Birney\n00:04:10\nReads \"A Prayer for Old Age\"  by W. B. Yeats.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:04:54\nThat I will use as an excuse for some of the poems I now shall read you, if I can find my list. The last thing. Ah yes, here it is. Now there's no mic and I want to make sure that everyone is hearing me. If I'm not talking loud enough, those that cannot hear, would you please put a hand up now. I'm very sorry, I'm very sorry--well, you will have to go to the back and then somebody who's standing can come here. I'm sorry there aren't, that some of you have to stand, and I'll try to make it as fast as possible so we can all get out of here. [Audience laughter]. I'm going to begin with some poems that are, alas, too well known to my fellow poets, most of them in this room, but I had planned it this way and I'm stuck with it now and so are they. I'm going to begin with a series that came out, some members of a series that came out in Ice Cod Bell or Stone, and later others in, Near False Creek Mouth, that have to do with wandering around the global village, and this one begins in, well it since begins in Vancouver, but it's about Honolulu [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q18094]. I got a fellowship to go to England [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q21] and I was in Vancouver and I discovered that it only cost me two hundred dollars and some odd cents more to go to London [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q84] and back to Vancouver by way of going around the world, you know, just heading west. The air tickets were accommodating me that way. So I decided to go west, and my first stop, I noticed, was Honolulu, and I began to get a bit of a temperature about that, and I thought, how 'bout, I might as well live it up, I'm going to Honolulu tomorrow morning, going to be there tomorrow night, and so I will engage a room in Hawaiian Village Hotel for the one night, because first night, I know I have a little money. After that, God knows what's going to happen to me because I intend to stay in a lot of places before I get to London. So I did this, I reserved a room before I left Vancouver, not realizing that this had put me in a bit of a box, because this is one of the Kaiser-Hilton hotels on Waikiki Beach [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q254861], and they have a special greeter who meets all the planes, just for people coming to them. And it happened, through another mischance, that I was the only one for that hotel, and this unsettled me so much I had to write about it. [Audience laughter]. Something which I call \"Twenty-Third Flight\" for reasons, well, the poem is imitative of another poet, much older, much greater, by the name of David. Not the one that I pushed off the cliff [audience laughter], the one who was a harpist.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:08:39\nReads \"Twenty-Third Flight\" [from Selected Poems 1940-1966; audience laughter throughout].\n \nAudience\n00:10:58\nApplause and laughter.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:11:06\nThank you very much, I hesitate to look as if I anticipated more applause, but I would much prefer it if you'd just let me rattle ahead here, for one thing it's getting hotter in here and more and more uncomfortable and as I say, let me get ahead with it, and so if at the end, of course, if anybody is still here with enough energy left, fine. Is there anybody who knows where water is available, any water hole out there in those vast cement deserts?\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:11:50\nThere should be some beside you, there.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:11:52\nUh, well, there's a water pitcher, and a water glass\u2026[audience laughter]. I'll prove it... [audience laughter].\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:12:05\nIf I drink it, it's okay.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:12:06\nYeah! ...Well, while George is away I'll read one of his poems. This one is called \"Honolulu\" and follows immediately after the other, but in between was about forty, twenty-four hours, I guess, in which I visited the very famous outdoor aviary, one of the world's famous aviaries, and also the aquarium and so on, and I also encountered a type, a Honolulu type of sorts. So this poem, which is perhaps about the involvement of people with animals through self-projection, and the involvement of human animals with each other. \n \nEarle Birney\n00:13:05\nReads \"Honolulu\" [from Selected Poems 1940-1966].\n \nEarle Birney\n00:14:41\nThen I went to Japan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q17], and I want to read you one little poem, this is my Zen poem, I guess. [Audience laughter]. Every poet has to have a Zen poem. Thank you, George. \n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:14:54\nOh ho, I could give you a Zen greeting. Alright. It's really cold. I tried to get it out of the Coke [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2813] machine but it just didn't work. \n \nEarle Birney\n00:15:03\nGood gin, thank you. \"Windchimes in a Temple Ruin\"--you know these little glass-leave things, which one expects to see in Japan, but not suddenly to hear when you're all alone in an old ruin. Some left up in the rafters.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:15:31\nReads \"Windchimes in a Temple Ruin\" [from Selected Poems 1940-1966].\n \nEarle Birney\n00:16:12\nBut I think I'm going to leave Asia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q48] for the moment, and get on to Europe [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q46], briefly, been around to Spain [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q29], at any rate. I was sitting, more or less minding my own business, on a plaza in Madrid [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2807] one morning, having my coffee, and something happened, which again I felt I should chronicle. Desmond Pacey [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5264782] says I'm a chronicler, and so I, having learned that, I now use the word [audience laughter] to explain what I'm doing. I renamed the plaza, it had a rather dull name, I call it Plaza de Inquisicion. \n \nEarle Birney\n00:17:09\nReads \u201cPlaza de Inquisicion\u201d [from Near False Creek Mouth and collected in Selected Poems 1940-1966].\n \nEarle Birney\n00:17:44\nI also went to the Prado [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q160112] of course, and saw, for the first time, the original of one of the three studies by El Greco [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q301] of The Espolio [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q52301456], or the taking-off and rending of Christ's garments, which was one of El Greco's themes. And I was struck, as I had never been really before, I suppose because I never had really looked at these paintings properly, I had looked at them in small illustrations--I was struck by the extraordinary amount of space which had been taken up, which El Greco had devoted to the carpenter who was making the holes in the cross preparatory to having Christ nailed to the cross. In fact, the whole lower third of the canvas is devoted to him in one of these three versions, and not only that but he is, they're facing us, with his back to Christ, and on the right and left are two of the Marys, whose eyes are on him. I felt that perhaps El Greco was trying to say something here, apart from what he was saying about the actual scene of the crucifixion, in a symbolic way, perhaps about something that happened to do, really, with this religion, but with, whatever we'd call it, religion, whatever we'd call it, of art. Or if not of art, but craft. It's a little, perhaps, exaggerated, to call the carpenter an artist, but it's obvious that he'd been very much at that moment a craftsman. And so I wrote \"El Greco: Espolio\".\n \nEarle Birney\n00:20:04\nReads \"El Greco: Espolio\" [from Selected Poems 1940-1966].\n \nEarle Birney\n00:22:29\nWhen I come to Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16], now, I'm going to kind of sneak in on the side by reading you a poem that has to do with a very remote, I suppose the most remote part of Canada, in fact, the piece of land that is even nearer to the North Pole [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q934] than Greenland [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q223] or anything the Russians have, Ellesmereland [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q146841]. And I will read it first of all in English, and then, more or less for the hell of it, I'm going to read it in a translation into Spanish, but anyway, because I think I like the sound of it in Spanish. It's short, so I've practiced my Spanish on it, and maybe I won't make too many boobs.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:23:30\nReads \"Ellesmereland\" in English [published later in The Collected Poems of Earle Birney, Vol 1].\n \nEarle Birney\n00:24:10\nReads \"Ellesmereland\" in Spanish.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:24:59\nWell I'll get down and turn to more familiar territory. \"Canada Case History\". This is a poem written quite a long time ago, in 1945, in fact, when I'd just got back from World War Number Two [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q362], I always have to be careful to name which one it is, people getting confused about how far back I go now. And I found that in 1967 I had to do a little patching and changing of this, because history had not only caught up with me, it had changed me. But here, first of all is the original. No, I don't think, I can't, I don't think I can bear to read the original, I think I'll just read you what, what happened to this poem in 1967 in the centennial year.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:26:09\nReads \"Canada: Case History\" [from Selected Poems 1940-1966; audience laughter throughout].\n \nEarle Birney\n00:28:15\nWell now I'm going to read you other various scrappy things about Canadian literature which have never been published and never will be, I think, sneak them out like this once in a while. \n \nEarle Birney\n00:28:38\nReads unnamed poem.\n \nAudience \n00:29:20\nLaughter.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:29:29\nThen there's John, Jean Cabot, as I think my school teacher, trying very hard to be bilingual, made us say, but it turns out he wasn't French at all, but Italian. His name was Giovanni Caboto [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q85642]. \n \nEarle Birney\n00:29:48\nReads \"John Cabot\" [published later as \u201cgiovanni caboto - john cabot\u201d in Rag & Bone Shop].\n \nAudience\n00:30:27\nLaughter.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:30:36\nThis is something to my publisher, when they brought out a book of mine, Ice Cod Bell or Stone, full of beautiful artwork, except that the man in charge of the artwork had never read the little poem, the \"Klein Ellesmereland\" that I've just read to you, and so never discovered that when I was talking about bells, I was talking about harebells, or flowers, and he put very large iron church bells into all the illustrations. [Audience laughter]. I had asked to see the artwork in advance and was told that the authors, that this was not the custom to show authors the artwork in advance, so I didn't see it. So all I could do at the end was write something. \"To the reader\u201d, which was not included in the volume.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:31:45\nReads \"To the reader\".\n \nEarle Birney\n00:32:39\nI went to spend a weekend a couple of years ago for the first time with Al Purdy [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4704621] in his shack in Ameliasburg [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4742321], and I had read a lot of his Ameliasburg poems before, and I knew Al, but this was a new experience to be actually in the country of the poet, particularly as it was so well staked out--nobody else has ever written about Ameliasburg and the country north of there. Or ever will, I think. But Al has used it, and the country, and developed it into part of the remarkable fineness of his poetry. \n \nEarle Birney\n00:33:33\nReads \"In Purdy's Ameliasburg\" [published later in Rag & Bone Shop]. \n \nEarle Birney\n00:37:13\nNow a poem about another part of Canada. Still Ontario [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1904], part of the north. This is a poem about driving west with somebody else, another guy, and...well there it is. It's called \"Way to the West\". Summertime.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:37:46\nReads \"Way to the West\" [from Selected Poems 1940-1966].\n \nEarle Birney\n00:41:45\nWell, I'm going to get out to the West Coast very briefly. I'm going to read you something toward the end of a long poem. The trouble with long poems is, you could never dare to read the whole thing to any audience. So I'll read you, it's toward the end of the thing called \"November walk near False Creek mouth\". The last page.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:42:26\nReads final section of \"November walk near False Creek mouth\" [from Near False Creek Mouth and collected later in Selected Poems 1940-1966].\n \nEND\n00:45:06\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n \nEarle Birney\n00:45:07\nI'm going to read you a few odd things which are to some extent experimental, I suppose. Most of these have not been published, and some of them I haven't read before. This one is called a \"Swahili Serenade\" and I'll tell you about it after I read it. It's Swahili Found Serenade, really. \n \nEarle Birney\n00:45:44\nReads \"Swahili Serenade\" [published later as \u201cfound swahili serenade\u201d in Rag & Bone Shop; audience laughter throughout].\n \nEarle Birney\n00:46:13\nWell, as some of you have already perceived, already noticed, this is made up, each line is a juke-box tune, it's just a very easy kind of poem to make up; I offer it to you as a formula for quick poetry, just sit down by a jukebox and pick off some titles. [Audience laughter]. Five minute poem. Here's another kind of found poem of a different sort, called, I call it \"Space Conquest\". That's about all that I've contributed to it. \"Space Conquest\".\n \nEarle Birney\n00:46:56\nReads \"Space Conquest\".\n \nEarle Birney\n00:47:33\nWell those ten lines, each of five syllables, came out of a computer at the University of Waterloo [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1049470] last week, into which we had programmed a hundred and eleven, the one hundred and eleven words of George Meredith's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q90238] \"Lucifer in Starlight,\" and the last thirty-three words of Archibald MacLeish's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q633354] \"The End of the World.\" Don't ask me why we picked those two poems, I had nothing to do with the picking of the poems. But some of us, two linguists, two linguist-isists, a mathematician, and myself, and masses of computers are producing this sort of poetry. It took point eight-three seconds, not even one second, to produce the hundred-some-odd lines, out of which I chose those ten. So you can see it doesn't take very long, once you've programmed the machine, to find the, you know, the entire text of Hamlet [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q41567], but this is what we have done so far, we haven't put too much time on it yet. Some things that I haven't had computers write for me, although perhaps I might have, or should have. This one's called \"Kooks of the Monk\". \n \nEarle Birney\n00:49:24\nReads \"Kooks of the Monk\".\n \nAudience\n00:49:37\nLaughter.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:49:39\nThat is sometimes called \"concrete\". Fun anyway, to do. This is something that I may not be able to finish, but I'll try it. It's the train from Cardiff [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q10690] to London. English trains sound different, of course. \n \nEarle Birney\n00:50:03\nPerforms \"Train from Cardiff to London\".\n \nAudience\n00:50:53\nLaughter.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:50:59\nThis is a found collage from one issue of the Toronto Daily Star [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1067299], called \"Toronto Daily Tele-Starlings\", and this is only a small part of the poem which has no beginning or end, it goes on forever if you read the whole of the Star.  \n \nEarle Birney\n00:51:22\nReads \"Toronto Daily Tele-Starlings\" [audience laughter throughout].\n \nEarle Birney\n00:53:26\nA series of poems with reference back to the Yeats poem I read at the beginning, perhaps. \n \nEarle Birney\n00:53:36\nReads \"Like an eddy\" [published later in Rag & Bone Shop and collected in Ghost in the Wheels: Selected Poems].\n\nEarle Birney\n00:55:42\nAnd, two short haikus.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:55:47\nReads [two of three haikus from \u201chokkai in the dew line snow\u201d, published later in Rag & Bone Shop and collected in Ghost in the Wheels: Selected Poems].\n \nEarle Birney\n00:56:16\nReads [\"BUILDINGS\", published later in Rag & Bone Shop and collected in The Collected Poems of Earle Birney, Vol 1].\n \nEarle Birney\n00:56:50\nAnd, a poem that is written in kind of an attempt to write something to express a tiny little bit of the pleasure I've had, through most of my life, in reading Chaucer [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5683]. Called \"I'm always going back to Chaucer\".\n \nEarle Birney\n00:57:20\nReads \"I'm always going back to Chaucer\" in Middle English.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:59:06\nNow something that has to do with my Shetland [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q47134] grand-aunt. Tea with my Shetland grand-aunt. This is a little, slightly different dialect. And there's a kind of an opposition of styles going on here. It's a very old poem, refurbished.\n \nEarle Birney\n00:59:32\nReads \"Tea at my Shetland Aunt\u2019s\" in a Shetland dialect [published later in The Collected Poems of Earle Birney, Vol 1].\n\n \nEarle Birney\n01:01:21\nWell now I'm going to turn back to older poems. To conclude. Hum...I'm going to read two or three poems that, who have some relationship to California [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q99] and Oregon [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q824]. First of all, a poem that, when I wrote it, I wrote it on the day of its date. I thought the date was going to be very significant. August the seven, 1964, Florence [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q862740], Oregon. And that was because on that day, the American fleet moved into the coast and shelled the coast of North Vietnam [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q881], against the international agreements into which the United States had entered some years before. And I thought that this would surely go down in living memory, as a deed of aggression and perfidy. But there have been so many since, almost every day, that everybody has forgotten about that first shelling of the shore from the Gulf of Tonkin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q212428]. But I happened to be on the shore of the Pacific [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q98] almost directly across from the Gulf of Tonkin, in fact, the waves that were coming in perhaps had their pulsing first on the other side. And this, one couldn't get it out of one's mind, having seen the morning papers and heard the radio, and I went, I had gone fishing with an American poet and his two boys. The salmon were running, coming in, but I have got less and less interested in killing even fish as I get older and softer, and I soon gave up even wanting to cook fish, and left it to the others, and I went up, because I had nothing to do then, I went up and I sat on a cliff, and started thinking about the sea out there, and cormorants fishing, and once in a while the flash of a seal coming up, also fishing, and I also suddenly realized I was sitting there just staring out at the sea and I began to think, I remembered Frost's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q168728] poem about how odd human beings are, you know, they go down to the sea and they sit and they all, they always look out at the sea, although they can't look very far out or very far in. And I thought that was exactly what I was feeling, the whole thing. But I thought well it's not really Frost's ocean, this is Robinson Jeffers' [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q734955] ocean, and here is this great eye of indifference, so I began my poem, called \"Looking from Oregon\" with a line from Robinson Jeffers about the Pacific: \"And what it watches is not our wars\".\n \nEarle Birney\n01:04:54\nReads \"Looking from Oregon\" [from Selected Poems 1940-1966].\n \nEarle Birney\n01:06:20\nAnd another little poem which is really a video poem, and I should put it on a screen but I forgot to bring my slides. Brought them as far as the hotel, but I forgot to bring them up here.  o you'll just have to visualize a poem shaped like a pair of stairs but coming up at you, and visualize yourself at the top of these stairs with your back against the side of a theatre, a campus theatre at the University of Oregon [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q766145], with signs of last week's shows, this one to go on tonight, that I'm waiting to go into, waiting for my friends, who have the tickets, and watching people come up these steps, the cars coming by and discharging people. \"Campus Theatre Steps\". Summertime, a beautiful summer night. \n \nEarle Birney\n01:07:14\nReads \"Campus Theatre Steps\" [from Selected Poems 1940-1966].\n \nEarle Birney\n01:08:04\nThen I was driving along the coast, a long time, and I was confronted with a sign that hadn't been there before. A billboard, with the same message multiplied up and down the coast and everywhere I went, since the last time I was there. Now I, this is my favourite state of the American Union, Oregon, absolutely beautiful, still, despite whatever, all the attempts of man to un-beautify it, there's still this great volcanic, snow-covered mountains, such, shaped a bit like Fujiyama [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q39231], there is also all those beautiful rocks and sea-lion caves and the pounding surf and the rhododendrons, the whole works. And there's these, this sign saying, \"Billboards Build Freedom of Choice, Courtesy of Oregon Chamber of Commerce\". I brooded about this, and being alone, I couldn't get the answer. What is the philosophy behind this? So I invented a hitchhiker, and I picked him up, and he told me, and this is what he said. This poem is dated 61-62, and Khruschev [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q35314] is still in power in Russia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q159]. \n \nEarle Birney\n01:09:36\nReads \"Billboards Build Freedom of Choice\" [from Near False Creek Mouth and collected later in Selected Poems 1940-1966].\n \nEarle Birney\n01:11:42\nWell, I think we'll slip down into Mexico [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q96] for a moment before we wind this show up. There's a very short little thing called Irapuato [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q816845]. Well it's all part, it's like, poetry is like guidebooks, you know, guidebooks are always pointing out irrational connections between things, and so is poetry, so sometimes they get together, and in this case the guidebook had told me that there were two things, sort of, that this place was famous for, and I had discovered they were right.\n \nEarle Birney\n01:12:29\nReads \"Irapuato\" [from Selected Poems 1940-1966].\n \nEarle Birney\n01:13:06\nReads \"Memory No Servant\" [from Near False Creek Mouth and collected later in Selected Poems 1940-1966].\n \nEarle Birney\n01:14:20\nA poem addressed to friend and writer George Lamming [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1340511], who's perhaps best known for his autobiography of his child as a poor negro boy on the island of Barbados [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q244]. George Lamming who wrote In the Castle of My Skin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q23307454], and who happened to be in Jamaica [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q766] when I went there, and was extremely hospitable to me, and so were all his friends. And when I left I wrote him this poem, which had to do with a split-second feeling, something, thing happening inside me, an internal happening, the night of the last party, the last night of the last party. \n \nEarle Birney\n01:15:18\nReads \"For George Lamming\" [from Near False Creek Mouth and collected later in Selected Poems 1940-1966].\n \nEarle Birney\n01:16:32\nWell just in case you would think that I am soft about this and I'm going to like anybody if their skin is darker than mine, I'll read you a counter-poem that happened to come out of the island of Trinidad [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q128323], out of some little external happening, perhaps in part, perhaps really just an internal happening.\n \nEarle Birney\n01:17:20\nReads \"Meeting of Strangers\" [from Near False Creek Mouth and collected later in Selected Poems 1940-1966].\n \nEarle Birney\n01:19:06\nAnd then a very brief little, Irving Layton [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1673289]-type poem from Curacao [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q25279]. Very much a...very pallid compared with Irving's, I must say.\n \nEarle Birney\n01:19:22\nReads \"Curacao\" [from Near False Creek Mouth and collected later in Selected Poems 1940-1966].\n \nAudience\n01:19:45\nLaughter.\n \nEarle Birney\n01:19:54\nNow I'm going to conclude with two pieces. One is about the farthest back of these poems. Although some things I've read tonight began earlier but have been revised, this one has not been particularly revised. It's called \"The Road to Nijmegen\" and was written in Holland [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q55] in January of 1945, the last winter of the war. Which was the coldest winter, and in this part of Holland, first the Germans in coming and then in retreating had cut down every tree anywhere around. The trees were used for fuel and for mine props and...And then we had come in, and if there were any trees left, we'd got them. And in fact, it was no longer a matter of trees, it was a matter of trying to find bits and pieces of coal and getting the coal working and getting the coal out of the hands of black marketeers. And meantime the people were cold, even colder than we were, and they also lacked food. This is a letter home to a friend.\n \nEarle Birney\n01:22:10\nReads \"The Road to Nijmegen\" [published later in The Collected Poems of Earle Birney, Vol 1].\n \nEarle Birney\n01:24:38\nAnd finally, \u201cFrom The Hazel Bough\u201d.\n \nEarle Birney\n01:24:48\nReads \"From the Hazel Bough\" [from Selected Poems 1940-1966 and collected ater in The Collected Poems of Earle Birney, Vol 1].\n \nEarle Birney\n01:25:41\nThank you very much.\n \nAudience\n01:25:43\nApplause.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n01:26:12\nI guess you've already said it for us, and I can only repeat, thanks very much, Earle.\n \nEND\n01:26:25\n[Cut off abruptly].",

So I will begin by reading a poem which was really written in answer to a critic. I've written two poems in answers to critics. And this is one of them. I call it \"Desperate Equations\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:03:47\nReads \"Desperate Equations\" [from The Wheel of Summer].\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:04:33\nThen I would like to go to, from that to a newer poem, one which I call \"Natures\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:04:44\nReads \"Natures\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:06:54\nAnd I'd like to just simply move from that to a poem which is called, \"Dandelion\". It's a poem that, well, the daughter of a famous poet likes it very much, and she recently said so, and so consequently I'm very fond of it at the moment. I think this is a kind of procedure among artists. They tend to like very much, at least for a little while, something that someone else likes. It's a poem which I say partially for my wife, it's a poem of affection, but I wouldn't just simply say \"for\" my wife, it's for all of you, too. \"Dandelion\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:07:40\nReads \"Dandelion\" [published later in Any Body\u2019s Song and collected in Selected Poems].\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:09:26\nI visited once a grotto in the southern coast of Italy [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q38], the Amalfi [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q80563] grotto, and it's typical of a whole series of such places. It's completely enclosed. You enter it...well actually, I was there a year ago, and it's a little disappointing, because, to sort of accommodate the tourist trade, they've blown out a little section of the wall, and they've hung a flapping canvas cloth over it. But eleven years ago this wasn't so, and you descend in an elevator into this inner room, and it's an absolutely magic place, it's explained to you, for instance, that about sixteen feet under the level of the sea, the Tyrrhenian Sea [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q38882], there's a large hole in the cave, and the sunlight, particularly in the morning, you come there about 11 in the morning, it's a good time, the sun filters down these sixteen feet and through this huge hole and then comes up inside the cafe. And the effect of this is absolutely eerie because it's completely enclosed, it's like darkness, but you get in there, and you adjust, and everything is just luminous with light, water, everything. You pick up, and you dip your hands in water and pick them up, you know, drops of water fall from your fingers from the orb-blades that splash, the orb is simply just a whole splash of light that goes up, like that. It's magic, see. And I want to believe in the magic, but in this sense I want to believe in this way in poetry. We shouldn't, I think, just simply deceive ourselves, but....so we can talk about what is, but somehow it's a responsibility to do a little bit more than what is, and so I've written this poem, and of course it's about the Amalfi Grotto, it's about our own behaviour, an attitude toward many things, and it's also, for me, a poem about poetry. \"The Amalfi Grotto\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:11:38\nReads \"The Amalfi Grotto\" [from The Wheel of Summer; later collected in Selected Poems].\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:12:53\nI would go from that to a poem for my brother. I call the poem \"War\". This was a brother who was killed in the Philippines [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q928] in World War II. I was in Europe at the time. I wrote thirty poems, at least, for him, following this. And finally I wrote this poem. This was...about eleven years afterwards when I got to this poem. And with this poem I knew I was, I was through writing those poems. It's also a poem that's had a very curious history. The history of poems is something that's difficult to predict. I was in Germany at the time, I suppose the next German soldier I met I would have shot. But this poem has been seen, or was seen a few years ago by a former infantry officer in the German Army, who at that moment was a captive at Stalingrad [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q914]. He's come into the United States [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30] now and teaches music in an American university, not the one I'm in. And so he set it to music. And so it's a strange irony. I started the whole sequence, see, but, see art pays no attention to that kind of enmity whatsoever. And so it's been set to music by a former infantry officer in the German army. Also, just this past week, actually two days ago, I got a notice it's been published in a Japanese anthology, and it's been translated into Italian, and so all the axis powers have translated it, and then somehow, I don't, still don't know how, it found its way after the Hungarian Revolution [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q164348] into Budapest [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1781] in '56, and got translated there, I understand a very poor translation into Hungarian, but nevertheless it's happened. This is just part of its history. And other things have been happening to it strangely like this. I just mention this because, see, at a certain point the thing is out of your control completely, and you sort of are, I feel a bit humbled by what happens to them, and the uses that people put these things to. I wrote poems in all sorts of forms for my brother, and I finally, there're some subjects...well, I'd heard William Carlos Williams [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q178106] give a reading at the Lexington Y in New York City [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60] in 1954, and so I said, okay, I was still dealing with the same poem, and I was in an apartment up in 96th Street, and it was a very foggy night coming home, and I heard all these great foghorns coming off over the lower bay, over Manhattan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q11299] and so forth. And I wrote another poem, \"A Seachange for Harold\", which I'm not going to read, except just the beginning.\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:16:22\nReads the beginning of \"A Seachange: For Harold\" [fromThe Green Town and collected later in Selected Poems].\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:16:40\nWell that's, I wrote that thing first, and then I came back to this other poem, in which I just said, okay I'll put it down the way it was, but there's some subjects that by their very nature you can't do much about. Except, of course, the whole dry feeling associated with it led me to all kinds of selections. If there seem to be an excess of family in the poem, I just simply say I am one of nine children. \n \nJoseph Langland\n00:17:15\nReads \"War\" [from The Green Town and later collected in Selected Poems].\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:18:43\nI would go from that to some poems I'm trying to write now. Some of these poems are songs, and I've been writing music for them, also, but, and this is such a song. I call it \"A Hard Song to Sing\", and it's really about the contemporary condition of war and civil rights problems which threaten to just overwhelm the United States. And almost the entire poem is monosyllabic, but it just seemed like it had to be that way. So. I...and actually, the tune that goes with this thing is...well, I know for instance that I could come in right on pitch on it. I once fell in love with--I don't have absolute pitch, but I fell in love with a song by Edward Grieg [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q80621], and all I have to do is remember this song and I can always begin singing in A flat. But, it's, sometimes I think that maybe this is what I mean by being so right with your subject that you finally say the right thing about it. Somehow the resonance, just the resonance of the idea set up in my body brings me in on pitch, see. Well, I'll just read it. \"The clear, cold night\"...oh I'll sing, I'll sing the one stanza. \n \nJoseph Langland\n00:20:24\nSings the beginning of \"A Hard Song to Sing\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:20:42.79\nAnd it repeats itself in various ways, the melody varies. \n \nJoseph Langland\n00:20:47\nReads \"A Hard Song to Sing\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:21:48\nI...when I spent some time in Europe, among other people I met Ralph Ellison [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q299965]. And he and his wife, Fanny, and my wife, Judy, and I, we spent several very fine noons on a beach of a small Italian fishing town, and ever since then I've been trying to write a poem for him. He's been relatively silent, at least, he's not taken a very aggressive role in the whole civil rights movement, although he has published significant essays in that whole thing. Many of you will know his great novel The Invisible Man [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1784288]. And I've written a poem, I call it \"An Open Letter to Ralph Ellison\", I'm reading it, I have to send it to him. I have not sent it out to be published anywhere, either. You probably do know he used to be a jazz player, he played the trumpet, he was a photographer and so forth and he did live in some sort of cellar that he had brilliantly lit for a while, but in The Invisible Man there are aspects of this kind of background, too. So I just wanted to address--I started writing him a letter. And then I got interested in writing in the letter and quit the letter and wrote the poem instead, but that's the way it'd be. It was \"Dear Ralph\", you know but just, now the poem begins, \"Ralph...\"\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:23:16\nReads \"An Open Letter to Ralph Ellison\" [published later in The Massachusetts Review vol. 40, n.4].\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:27:02\nWell, I will move from that to a poem on Thoreau [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q131149]. Actually, I'm doing a whole book of these things. But one...actually, the first time I ever went to Walden Pond [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2023853], things turned out like an art farm. There were certain people there, and I met people in certain sequences, and of course I've told all sorts of people that, when they write poetry, you know, just to say that this is the way it happened, or this is the way it was, you know, that's no guarantee that it will be art at all. But in this case, something else had happened, see, Thoreau himself plays influence and just simply organized, you know, a hundred years later, certain people who would be there. And this happened just this way, and so I, almost to defend myself against all the things I'd ever said to people, I called the poem, \"How It, So Help Me, Was\". And that's the title of the poem. I end with a, the blue-grey twilight, because it was 1963, and it was, or '62 when I went there, and it was, you know, a hundred years after the war between the North and the South in the United States, the blue and the grey. And I felt that whole shadow, and even, in a curious way, it's on the west end of the pond, actually, I'd gone swimming in it, it's illegal, but then the shadow was coming off the hill and it was just sort of beginning to cover, to cover me, and it was a blue-grey shadow, you see, I'm not making that up. And, but...I suppose that's a kind of selection you take out of what is made available to you at a certain point. So \"How It, So Help me, Was\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:29:04\nReads \"How It, So Help Me, Was\" [published in The Massachusetts Review, Vol. 4, n.1 and published later as \u201cWalden\u201d in Any Body\u2019s Song].\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:29:29\nThat's a little poem he's written that's on the hearth there, about the smoke rising.\n\nJoseph Langland\n00:30:04\nResumes reading \u201cHow it, So Help Me, Was\u201d. \n\nJoseph Langland\n00:32:10\nI know at a time like this I keep thinking all the time in poetry, you know, what does it mean in poetry to somehow keep alive, or...to keep the whole body open, and I wanted to write a poem about that. I call this one \"Still to be Man\". Because sort of in an animal way, we have to be able to continue to take in all sorts of things. \n \nJoseph Langland\n00:32:44\nReads \"Still to be Man\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:32:51\nI can remember when I was, the morning I was trying to write this poem because I was home alone, I stepped out the kitchen door and as I stepped out I felt I didn't even have to land on the earth itself, I would just step out into the air. \n \nJoseph Langland\n00:33:04\nResumes reading \"Still to be Man\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:34:10\nLast year, I spent, with my family, a half a year in Rome [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q220], and I got acquainted with a certain kind of syndrome among some of the Roman women. They sort of get trapped, in a society which seems free and easy and open, there's an extreme conservatism. For instance, I know, well, a person who teaches art in an American university, he and his wife were adopting some children in Italy a few years ago, and he could not have children and she could. It was proved by tests in this country, and they went to adopt two children in Italy. But you cannot adopt children in Italy on this basis because by law, no man in Italy can be sterile. [Audience laughter]. And this is a law. And so they had to go to Naples [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2634] and be tested all over again, officially, by a doctor in Naples, and a lawyer had to follow this, and they discovered after the tests that she was sterile and she was not [audience laughter], and they got this all certified and they adopted the children and they now have them and are living happily with them. But there's some, there's another side to this coin, too. And so, we lived next to a high school called the church, or the school of the Adorazione, and I'd see this women, you know, they're so beautiful when they're young, and then when they get married they start dressing in black and start cooking spaghetti and having children, and something awful happens, and then their husbands lose interest in them and then they have to find other lovers and then, you know, it's an awful thing. [Audience laughter]. It's \"La Donna a Roma, an Odyssey\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:36:12\nReads \"La Donna a Roma, an Odyssey\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:37:24\nWell then, another kind of thing that happens in our society, I think it happens to many people, I've been writing a series of half-songs. I call them half-songs, they're at half-pitch, half-singing pitch, where we talk and we don't talk together. You know, we say something and someone answers and it goes, you know, we keep going past each other. And so I've written a poem that, it has two separate parts, both parts rhyme all the way but you won't hear this at all, I was talking about that with the class here, today, it may be aesthetically valid for myself alone. And it's one, it's called \"Not Quite a Conversation: A Half-Song\", and the first part is called \"He and Her\". You see, \"he\" is the noun and \"her\" is the object. And the next part is called, \"She and Him\". \"She\" is the noun and \"him\" is the object. And they're talking. Or, we're talking about them. And so, in a sense they should be printed facing each other on the page, and I can't read them together, so I have to read first \"He and Her\", then I might, they talk back and forth to each other all the way through the poem. \"He and Her.\"\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:38:44\nReads \"Not Quite a Conversation: He and Her\" [published later in Any Body\u2019s Song].\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:39:40\nAnd the other, \"She and Him\". As I say, it rhymes all the way, and triad by triad it answers. \n \nJoseph Langland\n00:39:47\nReads \"Not Quite a Conversation: She and Him\" [published later in Any Body\u2019s Song].\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:40:59\nI guess we take a break in the program. \n \nUnknown\n00:41:05\nAmbient Sound [voices].\n \nUnknown\n00:41:24\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].  \n \nJoseph Langland\n00:41:25\nAnd, I will read just one or two of these. And once again, I make no particular claim as to the validity of this, and probably in the long run it\u2019s not even a fruitful thing. All my grandparents were born in Norway [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q20], my name is Langeland. You know, they dropped the 'e' and called it Langland. And I have been back there a couple of times, I might go again this summer and work with a Norwegian poet, Paul Brekke, and maybe another one, on some translations from the Norwegian  I don't know much Norwegian, he knows a lot of English. [Audience laughter]. But when I was going through there a year ago, I got two, two poems. First this one, \"Singing in Late Summer\". When my father died they played a folk song, \"Den store hvide Flok\", \"The Great White Host\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q10468796], at his funeral. And I'd sort of shipped my children off to jobs, I had, you know, I had a fourteen-year-old boy working on a ranch in Wyoming [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1214], and a twelve-year-old son working on a farm in Iowa, and a daughter who'd gone off to work in-- who was what, fifteen, sixteen, to a hotel in Switzerland [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q39], and my wife was in Provincetown [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q49154], painting [audience laughter], and I was at home writing. Which is what I wanted to do all the time, in any case. \"Singing in Late Summer\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:43:03\nReads \"Singing in Late Summer\" [published later in Any Body\u2019s Song and collected in Selected Poems].\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:44:17\nAnd then, traveling through Norway, all these rivers, you know, they just...they're tumbling all over, rushing everywhere, and falling off the tops of mountains, you know, it just seemed endless, going from Oslo to Bergen [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q26793] and Trondheim [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q25804] and down to Oslo and so forth. Or down to the Island of Store [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1636366] along the west coast of Norway. And so, I was thinking of a phrase I'd heard an old, an older woman in my own area say about the younger generation. She would always say, \"[inaudible phrase in Norwegian]\". And so I saw these rivers, and every time I saw them I kept saying, \"[inaudible phrase in Norwegian]\". [Laughter]. And so then I started thinking of all of these Norwegian immigrants that just came, you know, more of them over here than there are over there...and...so I, it's about the rivers, it's called \"Norwegian Rivers\", and it's about the people, the younger people, and it's about the immigrants, and the older immigrants, everything like that, I guess.\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:45:22\nReads \"Norwegian Rivers\" [published in The Massachusetts Review, Vol. 4, n.1 and collected later in Any Body\u2019s Song and in Selected Poems].\n\nJoseph Langland\n00:48:08\nWell, there's several like that. But I want to do some other things, so I'll just leave them alone. I'm...you know, I'm translating from the Russian, and no pretense about it, I have two great friends, Thomas Axel [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q23565070], who was press agent for Imre Nagy [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q177917] for eleven days, before, at the time of the Hungarian Revolution, and then he escaped to Austria [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q40]. He teaches at my university, he's a very fine poet, he used to be a director of theatre in Budapest, of the State Theatre. And then Laszlo Ticosz, he teaches in the German-Russian department at the university. They both, for years, have been collecting from the underground poems by relatively unknown poets, student poets and so forth, from Russia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q159], and they have a magnificent collection of these things. They give me, absolutely literal cribbed translations, and then I work with them, and there're some magnificent things coming, and I'm as certain as I stand here that the moment these things are sent into a publisher, not because of what I'm doing, but because of the nature of the thing, that it'll be just snapped up. This is relative, totally fresh new material, no one else has it, they have, through their own channels in the underground, they are being fed this. And so I find it very exciting, and as I said to someone today, I have to sort of take it through my own experience, which included...I won't say poverty, that's not the right word, but absolutely no money, not poverty because we could milk the cow and, you know, raise the garden vegetables and shear our sheep and make our own blankets and, you know, we had food, clothing, and shelter. And then the war in Europe, and I was in well, concentration camps, I wasn't in them, but I was, at Nordhausen [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7033], I sort of participated in the burial of five thousand people in one day in open trenches, and was with a headquarters unit a few days after and captured Buchenwald [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q152802], and it...I won't say it's these things that pulled together, I was in Weimar [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3955] when it was turned over to the Russians, I remember going out of there, you know, it was half the German population in their carts going toward Eisenach [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7070], to the west, and the Russian cavalry coming in, meeting it from the east...lots of things, but so that's simply what this material comes through, and so I have some sympathy for it. This is a poem \"Drowning\", by a person named Sergei Chudakov [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4517600]. \n \nJoseph Langland\n00:51:23\nReads \"Drowning\" by Sergei Chudakov [published later in Poetry from the Russian Underground].\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:51:31\nSee, in the original it says, \"bright as a house\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:51:36\nResumes reading \"Drowning\" by Sergei Chudakov.\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:52:06\nThis is \"The Jewish Cemetery in Leningrad\" by Joseph Brodsky [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q862]. \n \nJoseph Langland\n00:52:12\nReads \"The Jewish Cemetery in Leningrad\" by Joseph Brodsky.\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:52:32\nSee the poem says, \"lie musicians, lawyers, businessmen, and revolutionaries\". I'm very certain in this case that, you know, I felt great when I thought of saying it in this other way. Makes it better. \n \nJoseph Langland\n00:52:47\nResumes reading \"The Jewish Cemetery in Leningrad\" by Joseph Brodsky.\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:54:03\nFor instance, the original translation was that this whole thing is \"one hour by foot FROM the nearest bus stop\" And as far as I'm concerned, saying \"to\" is apt, a crucial difference, \"and the crooked faces of the plywood\", see, \"are one hour by foot TO the nearest bus stop\". Wanted the whole sense that they might all get up and walk and haunt us, see, coming the other way. Here's a poem about conditions by Artyemy Mikhailov. These names may be just be relatively anonymous, although some of them are among the friends that have been defending Sinyavsky [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q468267] and Daniel [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q435770]. His idea about conditions. And it was a pretty rigid, stiff poem and I had to try to get movement in it and so forth. And it's whole, if, if you've, if your dearest friend has not been trapped and dragged to a camp, if, if, if, the entire way through.\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:55:01\nReads \u201cConditions\u201d by Artyemy Mikahilov [published later in Poetry from the Russian Underground].\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:56:07\nHere once again, there's so many of these, I just, here's one in the older style but it's one that's full of an elegant, lyric despair, \"Now that I know\", by Vladimir Kovshin.\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:56:21\nReads \"Now that I Know\" by Vladimir Kovshin [published later in Poetry from the Russian Underground].\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:57:01\nThis is a poem called \"After the War\" by Gleb Garbovsky. I just completed this this previous weekend, these I'm reading from now. \n \nJoseph Langland\n00:57:11\nReads \"After the War\" by Gleb Garbovsky [published later in Poetry from the Russian Underground].\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:58:54\nIncidentally, I used the phrase \"called back\" because that's on Emily Dickinson's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4441]  tomb in Amherst [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q49164], Massachusetts. Just an example of how you get your own little allegiance and locality into something else. \n \nJoseph Langland\n00:59:08\nResumes reading \"After the War\" by Gleb Garbovsky.\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:59:27\nHere's one, \"Keeping up with the Humanskys\". It's a poem about keeping up with the Joneses. [Audience laughter]. I had a lieutenant in the army who said his name was Humansky, and he said his, that man, I'll never forget it because he said that means \"son of the fields\" but I've been called worse names. I remember him saying that [audience laughter]. And so I...Son of the fields, I thought, that's great, you know, I was looking for a Russian name that would be like the Joneses, only this is like the serfs, son of the fields, of the soil. Couldn't be better. \"Keeping up with the Humanskys\". So, see, that's my good luck out of a little piece of experience that came to me when I needed it. \n \nJoseph Langland\n01:00:06\nReads \"Keeping up with the Humanskys\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:01:33\nThen there's one about a march from Russia to Siberia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5428]. And, \"Etape\". There's no title in the original, there's a footnote, which was, these were sent to Axel and Ticosz from Russia, this poem. Neither the name nor the fate of its author is known. The phrase \"Marching in Etape\" originates from the nineteenth century. One stretch of the Long March from Russia to Siberia was called Etape, and it was in a ballad stanza form, so that's the way I did it. It's...little old style, but.\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:02:07\nReads \"Etape\" by an unknown author.\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:03:57\nThen \"The Garbage Collector,\" a poem that...\n \nUnknown\n01:04:03\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n\nJoseph Langland\n01:04:04\nReads \"The Garbage Collector\u201d [begins abruptly; audience laughter throughout].\n \nAudience\n01:04:27\nLaughter.\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:04:30\nI'm very proud of that too, because you know in the old Renaissance things there's always these, an infinitely wise Christ Child, you know, at the mother's breast but his eyes are looking out elsewhere, and he's pointing like this, you know, and it's, so I thought, you know, that's not quite the translation but it's mine [audience laughter]. \n\nJoseph Langland\n01:04:46\nResumes reading \u201cThe Garbage Collector\u201d.\n\nJoseph Langland\n01:05:32\nWell, these are, you know, poems out of new, unknown--\n \nUnknown\n01:05:36\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:05:37\nI've sort of been threatening to sing something, and the trouble is, I'm...as I...I wouldn't play the piano if there were one here, and I don't play the guitar, and if I play this thing, it's locked stuff, I'm tied to it, and, I haven't played this tape that's accompanying me, you know, for at least three weeks, and I haven't sung a note since I left Amherst, except the notes I sang here, so, that's all right. These are songs of all sorts. So this is my accompaniment. I hope it works, if it doesn't I'll just stop it. \n \nUnknown\n01:06:17\nAmbient Sound [music; recorded track]. \n \nJoseph Langland\n01:06:22\nListen here, just a song called \"All the Lovers that You Ever Knew\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:06:37\nPerforms \"All the Lovers that You Ever Knew\" [published later in Any Body\u2019s Song] accompanied by recorded track.\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:08:02\nThis next is a song called \"Alone the Evening Falls on Me\". Sometimes I wonder, just trying to remember it here, whether I'm supposed to start singing now, and I'll get to the end of the song and I won't have accompaniment for the last dance. [Audience laughter].\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:08:31\nPerforms \"Alone the Evening Falls on Me\" accompanied by recorded track [published later as \"Song At Evening\u201d in Any Body\u2019s Song and collected in Selected Poems] \n \nJoseph Langland\n01:10:23\nThis is a song called \"Jump on my Back\". It's about Iowa and Wyoming. But since Wyoming didn't work, I had to say Idaho [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1221]. [Audience laughter].\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:10:45\nPerforms \"Jump on my Back\" accompanied by recorded track.\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:11:25\nThis next one is called \"A Hiroshima Lullaby\". There's an infinitely sad story. In Hiroshima [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q34664] when the bomb fell, in 1945, there was a little girl, Sadako Sasaki [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q231997], two years old, some of you may know of her. She was a mile and a half from the centre of the blast and apparently unharmed. She was a very gay and popular girl, and her classmates loved her. And she was in the sixth grade or the equivalent, age twelve, in Hiroshima, Hiroshima, however you pronounce it.  And she developed leukemia, which is of course, as many of you know, a latent effect of many people exposed to radiation, so she was, after all, a victim. And she, well she finally became so ill she had to go to the hospital. And her friends came to visit her. And among other things, they told her, and that she knew, that there's an old Japanese legend about herons. I've been writing poem about herons and cranes and I have some in my book, one on a sandhill crane, and I told some people today that I'm going to the University of Oregon [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q766145] in June to speak in their summer Academy of the Arts, and I heard of a person who works in wildlife out in Oregon [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q824], and so because of the poem about the crane he's invited me to visit his wildlife refuge, about two or three hours east of Eugene [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q171224], where he has a refuge among other things for sandhill cranes, you know these water birds are simple. And so I'm going to visit him. I look forward to it. Not because of a poem, see, it's nice. And so, Sadako Sasaki in the hospital, she heard that if you fold a thousand paper cranes in this Japanese folding technique, this will protect your health and save you. So she started folding them. And the tale has two sides. She reached 964 and she died. Her classmates were so, at the centre so involved they completed the thousand, they formed them in a chain. They went around gathering the equivalent of pennies, around Japan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q17], and when they got enough they asked a sculptor from Tokyo [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1490] to make a statue of this girl, and so he made a statue showing...you'll surely see pictures of this if you haven't. It's a young, twelve year-old girl, you know, still with a girl's body, she's standing up like this....and she stands in the Peace Park in Hiroshima now. And over her, made out of gold, the folded crane. And so, I wanted to write a poem for her. And so just using the fifth in the bass, and then using the five notes, black keys, I wrote a little ballad and I'll probably sing one stanza maybe, and then read the rest. \n \nJoseph Langland\n01:15:03\nPerforms the beginning of \"A Hiroshima Lullaby\" [published later in Any Body\u2019s Song and collected in Selected Poems].\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:15:38\nReads the continuation of \u201cA Hiroshima Lullaby\" [published later in Any Body\u2019s Song and collected in Selected Poems].\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:16:49\nI wanted to write a civil rights song, something that you could march to in Madison Square Garden [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q186125]. And that's, you know, it's a marching song. That's like that. \n \nJoseph Langland\n01:17:15\nPerforms unnamed song accompanied by recorded track. \n \nJoseph Langland\n01:18:00\nStops recorded track. \n \nJoseph Langland\n01:18:00\nWell, there are a lot more of these songs and I'm just going to stop the tape at this time because...I haven't even begun reading you my favourite poems, [audience laughter], and I know it's about to end but maybe, maybe I can read for fifteen minutes or so. If you have to go, just get up and go. But. When I was in Italy in 1954, I read in Marcus Cunliffe's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6758114] The Literature of the United States, \"New York is the intellectual centre of the United States.\"  That made my blood boil [audience laughter] because it's a marketplace, so I just simply took his own book, The Literature of the United States, took all his authors, and lined them up, and all the places where they were born, where they grew up, and where they wrote from, and sent them the chart, which proves, out of his own book, that in literature, creative ideas, there have been three great centres and then two subordinate ones. New England [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q18389], the Midwest, and the South, and then as subordinate ones, they're the West Coast, and then the mid-Atlantic, New York area. That's in literature [audience laughter]. And we got in an argument...the result of it all was that I invited him to come and teach at my university [audience laughter]. So he came and he gave an address, and in one of his speeches he said, \u201cAmericans are overly given to haruspication and scrying\u201d [audience laughter]. Well, you know, when someone comes out of England [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q21] and says, gives, delivers a lecture to an American audience and says that, among other things you have to look up the words. [Audience laughter]. And, so...so I looked them up and I discovered \"haruspication\", the Haruspects were Roman and Etruscan pagan priests who examined the entrails of sacrificial animals [audience laughter] to predict natural phenomena and the future. So I started thinking about that. I grew up on a general farm, we had about a hundred pigs, two hundred sheep, a hundred head of cattle, twenty milk cows, a thousand chickens, about one hundred turkeys, twelve goats, you know [audience laughter], anywhere from twenty to fifty cats, and all sorts of wild animals, and I had seen bulls gored to death, I had seen flocks of sheep driven over limestone cliffs by dogs, I'd seen hawks that'd ripped little lambs and chickens, I'd seen skunks that had eaten them up, I'd butchered all of these things, I'd castrated, you know, I myself have castrated maybe three thousand pigs, and [laughter]..and...so, I thought okay. In fact, some of you may know that \"The Wheel of Summer\", the title poem, is about the castration of one hundred pigs, by three teenage boys [audience laughter], and as I was introduced in England once, he said it's probably the most distinguished poem in English about the castration of a hundred pigs. [Audience laughter]. But I started thinking about all of this and I thought, well, okay, I have a philosophy of life too, and it's been based with the whole business of producing food for you. You know, that's the end of it, the end of it all. And I participated in an awful lot of killing and...routine, it\u2019s a way of life. And you know, if you eat meat, well you too. So I said, well okay, I've been haruspicating for a long time. And I gradually went up from age six to age eighteen, and meantime I achieved some kind of maturity, and I'm going to write my own poems. So I wrote all these poems, and the titles are, you know, like \"Sacrifice of a Rainbow Trout\", \"Sacrifice of My Pet Lamb\", but I'm going to read you the ultimate titles, which aren't in the book. Just running from age six on up to age eighteen, or when we got all old enough and we all went off to the war, as the last poem said.  But these say, you know, that's what these poems are really about.  \n \nJoseph Langland\n01:22:38\n\"The Clarity of Innocence: Sacrifice of a Trout\". \u201cThe Loss of Early Innocence: Sacrifice of My Pet Lamb\". \"The Plunder of Idealism: Sacrifice of the Golden Owl\". \"The Sickle among the Flowers\"...I quit making the equation...\"The Sickle Among the Flowers\". \"The Decline of Heroic Voices\"--that's the goring to death of a bull. \"The Suffocations of Love\"--that's the killing a pet chick by over-affection. \"The Attritions of Man\". \"The Unhousing of Beneficent God\". \"The Seeming, the Necessary and Beneficial Perversions of Love\"--that's my sacrifice of a gunny sack of cats. \"The Subtleties of Violent Revenge: Sacrifice of an old Sow\". \"The Sweet Solace of Evil\". \"The Absurdities of Fact\". \"The Pitfalls of Group Action: Sacrifice of a Flock of Sheep\"--they ran over this cliff, twelve of them died at once, and people say you shouldn't write villanelles, but that's the way sheep act, so I wrote a villanelle, you know, they repeat. \"The Catechism of Human Culpability\"--that's Eric, a suicide of a man. \"The Oddities of Affection\". \"The Sacred Violence of Purity\". \"The Bounties of Natural Law\". \"The Winter of the Cold War: Sacrifice of a Grey Wolf\". \"The Decline of Natural Instincts: Sacrifice of Three Wild Geese\". \"The Tyranny of Fixed Ideas\"--that's a sacrifice of a red squirrel. \"A Dream of the Ultimate Holocaust: Sacrifice of a Hill of Ants\" and \"The Warfare of the Sensuous Past: Sacrifice of My Aunt Marie\".  And then it all culminates in the longer narrative poem, \"The Wheel of Summer\". Which is just simply coming to maturity as a man. Well I'll, I'll read a few of these. \"Sacrifice of a Rainbow Trout\" has no music, but I oftentimes start singing when I'm reading it, but I'm not going to now, I've done that. \n \nJoseph Langland\n01:24:43\n\"Suddenly\"--this is six years old, you know.\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:24:46\nReads \"Sacrifice of a Rainbow Trout\" [from The Wheel of Summer and collected later in Selected Poems].\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:25:42\nI'll skip the lamb and read the owl. I wanted to just talk--\"We strung our wind-up rooster dead on a post\"--see, it can't be any flatter than that. \n \nJoseph Langland\n01:25:52\nReads \"Sacrifice of the Golden Owl\" [from The Wheel of Summer and later collected in Selected Poems].\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:27:39\nI'll read the one of the neighbors. No one can live on a, in a farm area without seeing over a period of years, people lose fingers, toes, arms, legs, in various ways. It's...I was on a reading tour, actually, when Kennedy [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q9696] was killed. And I was actually in an auditorium about to start reading these poems, when it was cancelled, because of the announced death of the president. I couldn't have read them, but I didn't know what I was going to do. I was just sitting there, and five minutes from starting time. But this is \"Sacrifice of my Neighbors\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:28:20\nReads \"Sacrifice of my Neighbors\" [from The Wheel of Summer].\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:28:39\nThat was my brother.\n\nJoseph Langland\n01:28:42\nResumes reading \u201cSacrifice of my Neighbors\u201d.\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:31:02\n\"Sacrifice of the Gunnysack of Cats\". I read it in New York City, I didn't know that the officers of the Society for the Friends of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals were sitting in the audience. After I went back to Amherst I got a letter from them, saying that every year there are twenty-five million unwanted pets born in the United States [audience laughter] and we secure funds to get the females spayed and the males castrated, and your poem, \"The Sacrifice of the Gunnysack of Cats\" is perfect for our purposes for our annual appeal, and, could we...[audience laughter.]..could we use it, please. I thought, my God, you know, I just, I read this poem, like all of these things out of a great affection, and this is the thing, you'll have to forgive me but this is what occurred to me, you know. I just had this great affectionate conception of the whole thing, and now they wanted to turn it into a kind of contraceptive. [Audience laughter]. And...and then I thought, well, okay, what can I do at this point? And so, showing this charming little picture, you know, it's a dog, and a little puppy dog [audience laughter], little kitten and laying their heads against each other and saying \"Annual Appeal\" and on the back of it was my \"Sacrifice of the Gunnysack of Cats\" and...I, you know, when I travel around the United States even now, I often like wonder in what town did I do in this poor little male cat or this female, you know, cooperating in one way or another, it's like, you know, I have to refuse to pay your taxes...you don't know what you're maiming at a certain point. But that's an example. I wanted to start from the most ordinary thing and see how I could carry it, and this is the \"Sacrifice of the Gunnysack of Cats\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:33:13\nReads \"Sacrifice of the Gunnysack of Cats\" [from The Wheel of Summer and collected later in Selected Poems].\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:36:23\nOne hard poem about the old sow, which is, says something about this world. \n \nJoseph Langland\n01:36:31\nReads \"Sacrifice of an Old Sow\" [from The Wheel of Summer and later collected in Selected Poems].\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:37:48\nWell that's the way we do it. Then one, pretty hard poem, too, it's about Eric, but it's really about us, and then I'll read the squirrel poem, and then leave these alone. That...okay, actually this, I had in mind an uncle, a favourite uncle. Very talented, frustrated.\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:38:19\nReads [\"The Sacrifice of Eric\u201d from The Wheel of Summer and collected later in Selected Poems].\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:41:09\nAlright, and then the squirrel. Actually, I...last week, I had a letter from some fellow in Kansas [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1558], I never, of course I don't know him at all. He wants to set the thing to music, I don't know what he's going to do with it, but...he plays the guitar, and so I said, fine. And just about anybody who gets caught in a rut...I must say that after this I'm going to read one little ballad on Adlai Stevenson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q311719], but...\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:41:47\nReads [\"The Sacrifice of a Red Squirrel\" from The Wheel of Summer]. \n \nJoseph Langland\n01:44:25\nLittle ballad for Stevenson, and I don't have it with me, but I know it. The state tree, bird, and flower of Illinois [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1204] is the oak, the cardinal, and the violet. That's green, red, and violet. It struck me, that's half a rainbow. That seemed like Adlai Stevens' life. A great theoretical life, unfinished, has to be completed by someone else. I asked, what's the other half, they're yellow, orange, and blue, and his home at Libertyville [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1787181], Illinois, you can't improve on that for the title, \"Libertyville\", it has a river the Des Plaines River [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q8637], that's before it enters the Chicago [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1297] drainage system, it's a nice blue stream out of the Wisconsin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1537] woods, that's blue, the sky is blue, the light by day is orange, and by night yellow. That's the full rainbow. \"There's a fountain in the wood\"...It's called \"Libertyville\" and past that, a little epigraph about the state tree, bird, and flower of Illinois, and I wanted to, for the schoolchildren of Illinois...\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:45:27\nReads \"Libertyville\" [from The Wheel of Summer and collected later in Selected Poems].\n \nAudience\n01:47:02\nApplause.\n \nEND\n01:47:35\n"

                "notes": "American poet Joseph Langland was born on February 16, 1917, in Spring Grove, Minnesota. He grew up on his family\u2019s farm in Iowa, which had been in his family since 1877. He attended Santa Ana College of California, then the University of Iowa, from which he received his Bachelor\u2019s degree in 1940. A year later, the University of Iowa also awarded him his Master\u2019s degree. Langland taught English during 1941 and 1942 at Dana College in Nebraska. Langland enlisted in the U.S. Infantry from 1942-1946, where he served in Europe during the Second World War. On his trips back to the U.S., Langland married Judith Gail Wood, and had three children. After the war, he served with the Military Government in Bavaria, going on to liberate the Concentration Camp at Buchenwald. By the time Langland left the military in 1946, he had risen to the position of Captain. Langland self-published his first collection of poetry, For Harold  in 1945 while still in Germany. He then taught at the University of Iowa from 1946-1948, at the University of Wyoming from 1948-1959, then to the University of Massachusets, Amherst from 1959-1979 as a Professor Emeritus and as the founder and Director of the Masters of Fine Arts writing program from 1964-1970 and from 1978-1979. Langland published more collections of poetry, including The Green Town (Scribner Press, 1956), The Wheel of Summer (Dial Press, 1963), An Interview and Fourteen Poems (GOB Press, 1973), The Sacrifice Poems (1975), co-edited The Short Story (Macmillan, 1956), and Poet\u2019s Choice with Paul Engel (Dial Press, 1962), co-translated Poetry From the Russian Underground (Harper & Row, 1973). Langland was awarded many honours, including the Ford Fellowship in Humanities in 1953 from the Harvard-Columbia Universities, the Amy Lowell Fellowship in Poetry in 1966, the Melville Can Prize for Poetry from the Poetry Society of America in 1964, an honorary doctorate from Luther College in 1974, and the Living Art Treasure in Literature from the New England Arts Biennial in 1985. He also traveled to guest lecture at the University of Washington, The University of British Columbia and at San Francisco State University. His last publications include Any Body\u2019s Song (Doubleday, 1980), A Dream of Love (Pleiades Press, 1986), Twelve Preludes and Postludes (Adastra Press, 1988) and Selected Poems (University of Massachusetts Press,1991).

Ladies and gentlemen, Professor Joseph Langland. \n \nAudience\n00:03:03\nApplause. \n \nJoseph Langland\n00:03:19\nSo much of that sounds irrelevant. So I will begin by reading a poem which was really written in answer to a critic. I've written two poems in answers to critics. And this is one of them. I call it \"Desperate Equations\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:03:47\nReads \"Desperate Equations\" [from The Wheel of Summer].\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:04:33\nThen I would like to go to, from that to a newer poem, one which I call \"Natures\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:04:44\nReads \"Natures\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:06:54\nAnd I'd like to just simply move from that to a poem which is called, \"Dandelion\". It's a poem that, well, the daughter of a famous poet likes it very much, and she recently said so, and so consequently I'm very fond of it at the moment. I think this is a kind of procedure among artists. They tend to like very much, at least for a little while, something that someone else likes. It's a poem which I say partially for my wife, it's a poem of affection, but I wouldn't just simply say \"for\" my wife, it's for all of you, too. \"Dandelion\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:07:40\nReads \"Dandelion\" [published later in Any Body\u2019s Song and collected in Selected Poems].\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:09:26\nI visited once a grotto in the southern coast of Italy [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q38], the Amalfi [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q80563] grotto, and it's typical of a whole series of such places. It's completely enclosed. You enter it...well actually, I was there a year ago, and it's a little disappointing, because, to sort of accommodate the tourist trade, they've blown out a little section of the wall, and they've hung a flapping canvas cloth over it. But eleven years ago this wasn't so, and you descend in an elevator into this inner room, and it's an absolutely magic place, it's explained to you, for instance, that about sixteen feet under the level of the sea, the Tyrrhenian Sea [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q38882], there's a large hole in the cave, and the sunlight, particularly in the morning, you come there about 11 in the morning, it's a good time, the sun filters down these sixteen feet and through this huge hole and then comes up inside the cafe. And the effect of this is absolutely eerie because it's completely enclosed, it's like darkness, but you get in there, and you adjust, and everything is just luminous with light, water, everything. You pick up, and you dip your hands in water and pick them up, you know, drops of water fall from your fingers from the orb-blades that splash, the orb is simply just a whole splash of light that goes up, like that. It's magic, see. And I want to believe in the magic, but in this sense I want to believe in this way in poetry. We shouldn't, I think, just simply deceive ourselves, but....so we can talk about what is, but somehow it's a responsibility to do a little bit more than what is, and so I've written this poem, and of course it's about the Amalfi Grotto, it's about our own behaviour, an attitude toward many things, and it's also, for me, a poem about poetry. \"The Amalfi Grotto\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:11:38\nReads \"The Amalfi Grotto\" [from The Wheel of Summer; later collected in Selected Poems].\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:12:53\nI would go from that to a poem for my brother. I call the poem \"War\". This was a brother who was killed in the Philippines [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q928] in World War II. I was in Europe at the time. I wrote thirty poems, at least, for him, following this. And finally I wrote this poem. This was...about eleven years afterwards when I got to this poem. And with this poem I knew I was, I was through writing those poems. It's also a poem that's had a very curious history. The history of poems is something that's difficult to predict. I was in Germany at the time, I suppose the next German soldier I met I would have shot. But this poem has been seen, or was seen a few years ago by a former infantry officer in the German Army, who at that moment was a captive at Stalingrad [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q914]. He's come into the United States [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30] now and teaches music in an American university, not the one I'm in. And so he set it to music. And so it's a strange irony. I started the whole sequence, see, but, see art pays no attention to that kind of enmity whatsoever. And so it's been set to music by a former infantry officer in the German army. Also, just this past week, actually two days ago, I got a notice it's been published in a Japanese anthology, and it's been translated into Italian, and so all the axis powers have translated it, and then somehow, I don't, still don't know how, it found its way after the Hungarian Revolution [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q164348] into Budapest [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1781] in '56, and got translated there, I understand a very poor translation into Hungarian, but nevertheless it's happened. This is just part of its history. And other things have been happening to it strangely like this. I just mention this because, see, at a certain point the thing is out of your control completely, and you sort of are, I feel a bit humbled by what happens to them, and the uses that people put these things to. I wrote poems in all sorts of forms for my brother, and I finally, there're some subjects...well, I'd heard William Carlos Williams [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q178106] give a reading at the Lexington Y in New York City [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60] in 1954, and so I said, okay, I was still dealing with the same poem, and I was in an apartment up in 96th Street, and it was a very foggy night coming home, and I heard all these great foghorns coming off over the lower bay, over Manhattan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q11299] and so forth. And I wrote another poem, \"A Seachange for Harold\", which I'm not going to read, except just the beginning.\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:16:22\nReads the beginning of \"A Seachange: For Harold\" [fromThe Green Town and collected later in Selected Poems].\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:16:40\nWell that's, I wrote that thing first, and then I came back to this other poem, in which I just said, okay I'll put it down the way it was, but there's some subjects that by their very nature you can't do much about. Except, of course, the whole dry feeling associated with it led me to all kinds of selections. If there seem to be an excess of family in the poem, I just simply say I am one of nine children. \n \nJoseph Langland\n00:17:15\nReads \"War\" [from The Green Town and later collected in Selected Poems].\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:18:43\nI would go from that to some poems I'm trying to write now. Some of these poems are songs, and I've been writing music for them, also, but, and this is such a song. I call it \"A Hard Song to Sing\", and it's really about the contemporary condition of war and civil rights problems which threaten to just overwhelm the United States. And almost the entire poem is monosyllabic, but it just seemed like it had to be that way. So. I...and actually, the tune that goes with this thing is...well, I know for instance that I could come in right on pitch on it. I once fell in love with--I don't have absolute pitch, but I fell in love with a song by Edward Grieg [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q80621], and all I have to do is remember this song and I can always begin singing in A flat. But, it's, sometimes I think that maybe this is what I mean by being so right with your subject that you finally say the right thing about it. Somehow the resonance, just the resonance of the idea set up in my body brings me in on pitch, see. Well, I'll just read it. \"The clear, cold night\"...oh I'll sing, I'll sing the one stanza. \n \nJoseph Langland\n00:20:24\nSings the beginning of \"A Hard Song to Sing\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:20:42.79\nAnd it repeats itself in various ways, the melody varies. \n \nJoseph Langland\n00:20:47\nReads \"A Hard Song to Sing\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:21:48\nI...when I spent some time in Europe, among other people I met Ralph Ellison [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q299965]. And he and his wife, Fanny, and my wife, Judy, and I, we spent several very fine noons on a beach of a small Italian fishing town, and ever since then I've been trying to write a poem for him. He's been relatively silent, at least, he's not taken a very aggressive role in the whole civil rights movement, although he has published significant essays in that whole thing. Many of you will know his great novel The Invisible Man [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1784288]. And I've written a poem, I call it \"An Open Letter to Ralph Ellison\", I'm reading it, I have to send it to him. I have not sent it out to be published anywhere, either. You probably do know he used to be a jazz player, he played the trumpet, he was a photographer and so forth and he did live in some sort of cellar that he had brilliantly lit for a while, but in The Invisible Man there are aspects of this kind of background, too. So I just wanted to address--I started writing him a letter. And then I got interested in writing in the letter and quit the letter and wrote the poem instead, but that's the way it'd be. It was \"Dear Ralph\", you know but just, now the poem begins, \"Ralph...\"\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:23:16\nReads \"An Open Letter to Ralph Ellison\" [published later in The Massachusetts Review vol. 40, n.4].\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:27:02\nWell, I will move from that to a poem on Thoreau [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q131149]. Actually, I'm doing a whole book of these things. But one...actually, the first time I ever went to Walden Pond [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2023853], things turned out like an art farm. There were certain people there, and I met people in certain sequences, and of course I've told all sorts of people that, when they write poetry, you know, just to say that this is the way it happened, or this is the way it was, you know, that's no guarantee that it will be art at all. But in this case, something else had happened, see, Thoreau himself plays influence and just simply organized, you know, a hundred years later, certain people who would be there. And this happened just this way, and so I, almost to defend myself against all the things I'd ever said to people, I called the poem, \"How It, So Help Me, Was\". And that's the title of the poem. I end with a, the blue-grey twilight, because it was 1963, and it was, or '62 when I went there, and it was, you know, a hundred years after the war between the North and the South in the United States, the blue and the grey. And I felt that whole shadow, and even, in a curious way, it's on the west end of the pond, actually, I'd gone swimming in it, it's illegal, but then the shadow was coming off the hill and it was just sort of beginning to cover, to cover me, and it was a blue-grey shadow, you see, I'm not making that up. And, but...I suppose that's a kind of selection you take out of what is made available to you at a certain point. So \"How It, So Help me, Was\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:29:04\nReads \"How It, So Help Me, Was\" [published in The Massachusetts Review, Vol. 4, n.1 and published later as \u201cWalden\u201d in Any Body\u2019s Song].\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:29:29\nThat's a little poem he's written that's on the hearth there, about the smoke rising.\n\nJoseph Langland\n00:30:04\nResumes reading \u201cHow it, So Help Me, Was\u201d. \n\nJoseph Langland\n00:32:10\nI know at a time like this I keep thinking all the time in poetry, you know, what does it mean in poetry to somehow keep alive, or...to keep the whole body open, and I wanted to write a poem about that. I call this one \"Still to be Man\". Because sort of in an animal way, we have to be able to continue to take in all sorts of things. \n \nJoseph Langland\n00:32:44\nReads \"Still to be Man\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:32:51\nI can remember when I was, the morning I was trying to write this poem because I was home alone, I stepped out the kitchen door and as I stepped out I felt I didn't even have to land on the earth itself, I would just step out into the air. \n \nJoseph Langland\n00:33:04\nResumes reading \"Still to be Man\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:34:10\nLast year, I spent, with my family, a half a year in Rome [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q220], and I got acquainted with a certain kind of syndrome among some of the Roman women. They sort of get trapped, in a society which seems free and easy and open, there's an extreme conservatism. For instance, I know, well, a person who teaches art in an American university, he and his wife were adopting some children in Italy a few years ago, and he could not have children and she could. It was proved by tests in this country, and they went to adopt two children in Italy. But you cannot adopt children in Italy on this basis because by law, no man in Italy can be sterile. [Audience laughter]. And this is a law. And so they had to go to Naples [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2634] and be tested all over again, officially, by a doctor in Naples, and a lawyer had to follow this, and they discovered after the tests that she was sterile and she was not [audience laughter], and they got this all certified and they adopted the children and they now have them and are living happily with them. But there's some, there's another side to this coin, too. And so, we lived next to a high school called the church, or the school of the Adorazione, and I'd see this women, you know, they're so beautiful when they're young, and then when they get married they start dressing in black and start cooking spaghetti and having children, and something awful happens, and then their husbands lose interest in them and then they have to find other lovers and then, you know, it's an awful thing. [Audience laughter]. It's \"La Donna a Roma, an Odyssey\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:36:12\nReads \"La Donna a Roma, an Odyssey\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:37:24\nWell then, another kind of thing that happens in our society, I think it happens to many people, I've been writing a series of half-songs. I call them half-songs, they're at half-pitch, half-singing pitch, where we talk and we don't talk together. You know, we say something and someone answers and it goes, you know, we keep going past each other. And so I've written a poem that, it has two separate parts, both parts rhyme all the way but you won't hear this at all, I was talking about that with the class here, today, it may be aesthetically valid for myself alone. And it's one, it's called \"Not Quite a Conversation: A Half-Song\", and the first part is called \"He and Her\". You see, \"he\" is the noun and \"her\" is the object. And the next part is called, \"She and Him\". \"She\" is the noun and \"him\" is the object. And they're talking. Or, we're talking about them. And so, in a sense they should be printed facing each other on the page, and I can't read them together, so I have to read first \"He and Her\", then I might, they talk back and forth to each other all the way through the poem. \"He and Her.\"\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:38:44\nReads \"Not Quite a Conversation: He and Her\" [published later in Any Body\u2019s Song].\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:39:40\nAnd the other, \"She and Him\". As I say, it rhymes all the way, and triad by triad it answers. \n \nJoseph Langland\n00:39:47\nReads \"Not Quite a Conversation: She and Him\" [published later in Any Body\u2019s Song].\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:40:59\nI guess we take a break in the program. \n \nUnknown\n00:41:05\nAmbient Sound [voices].\n \nUnknown\n00:41:24\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].  \n \nJoseph Langland\n00:41:25\nAnd, I will read just one or two of these. And once again, I make no particular claim as to the validity of this, and probably in the long run it\u2019s not even a fruitful thing. All my grandparents were born in Norway [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q20], my name is Langeland. You know, they dropped the 'e' and called it Langland. And I have been back there a couple of times, I might go again this summer and work with a Norwegian poet, Paul Brekke, and maybe another one, on some translations from the Norwegian  I don't know much Norwegian, he knows a lot of English. [Audience laughter]. But when I was going through there a year ago, I got two, two poems. First this one, \"Singing in Late Summer\". When my father died they played a folk song, \"Den store hvide Flok\", \"The Great White Host\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q10468796], at his funeral. And I'd sort of shipped my children off to jobs, I had, you know, I had a fourteen-year-old boy working on a ranch in Wyoming [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1214], and a twelve-year-old son working on a farm in Iowa, and a daughter who'd gone off to work in-- who was what, fifteen, sixteen, to a hotel in Switzerland [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q39], and my wife was in Provincetown [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q49154], painting [audience laughter], and I was at home writing. Which is what I wanted to do all the time, in any case. \"Singing in Late Summer\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:43:03\nReads \"Singing in Late Summer\" [published later in Any Body\u2019s Song and collected in Selected Poems].\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:44:17\nAnd then, traveling through Norway, all these rivers, you know, they just...they're tumbling all over, rushing everywhere, and falling off the tops of mountains, you know, it just seemed endless, going from Oslo to Bergen [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q26793] and Trondheim [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q25804] and down to Oslo and so forth. Or down to the Island of Store [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1636366] along the west coast of Norway. And so, I was thinking of a phrase I'd heard an old, an older woman in my own area say about the younger generation. She would always say, \"[inaudible phrase in Norwegian]\". And so I saw these rivers, and every time I saw them I kept saying, \"[inaudible phrase in Norwegian]\". [Laughter]. And so then I started thinking of all of these Norwegian immigrants that just came, you know, more of them over here than there are over there...and...so I, it's about the rivers, it's called \"Norwegian Rivers\", and it's about the people, the younger people, and it's about the immigrants, and the older immigrants, everything like that, I guess.\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:45:22\nReads \"Norwegian Rivers\" [published in The Massachusetts Review, Vol. 4, n.1 and collected later in Any Body\u2019s Song and in Selected Poems].\n\nJoseph Langland\n00:48:08\nWell, there's several like that. But I want to do some other things, so I'll just leave them alone. I'm...you know, I'm translating from the Russian, and no pretense about it, I have two great friends, Thomas Axel [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q23565070], who was press agent for Imre Nagy [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q177917] for eleven days, before, at the time of the Hungarian Revolution, and then he escaped to Austria [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q40]. He teaches at my university, he's a very fine poet, he used to be a director of theatre in Budapest, of the State Theatre. And then Laszlo Ticosz, he teaches in the German-Russian department at the university. They both, for years, have been collecting from the underground poems by relatively unknown poets, student poets and so forth, from Russia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q159], and they have a magnificent collection of these things. They give me, absolutely literal cribbed translations, and then I work with them, and there're some magnificent things coming, and I'm as certain as I stand here that the moment these things are sent into a publisher, not because of what I'm doing, but because of the nature of the thing, that it'll be just snapped up. This is relative, totally fresh new material, no one else has it, they have, through their own channels in the underground, they are being fed this. And so I find it very exciting, and as I said to someone today, I have to sort of take it through my own experience, which included...I won't say poverty, that's not the right word, but absolutely no money, not poverty because we could milk the cow and, you know, raise the garden vegetables and shear our sheep and make our own blankets and, you know, we had food, clothing, and shelter. And then the war in Europe, and I was in well, concentration camps, I wasn't in them, but I was, at Nordhausen [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7033], I sort of participated in the burial of five thousand people in one day in open trenches, and was with a headquarters unit a few days after and captured Buchenwald [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q152802], and it...I won't say it's these things that pulled together, I was in Weimar [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3955] when it was turned over to the Russians, I remember going out of there, you know, it was half the German population in their carts going toward Eisenach [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7070], to the west, and the Russian cavalry coming in, meeting it from the east...lots of things, but so that's simply what this material comes through, and so I have some sympathy for it. This is a poem \"Drowning\", by a person named Sergei Chudakov [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4517600]. \n \nJoseph Langland\n00:51:23\nReads \"Drowning\" by Sergei Chudakov [published later in Poetry from the Russian Underground].\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:51:31\nSee, in the original it says, \"bright as a house\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:51:36\nResumes reading \"Drowning\" by Sergei Chudakov.\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:52:06\nThis is \"The Jewish Cemetery in Leningrad\" by Joseph Brodsky [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q862]. \n \nJoseph Langland\n00:52:12\nReads \"The Jewish Cemetery in Leningrad\" by Joseph Brodsky.\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:52:32\nSee the poem says, \"lie musicians, lawyers, businessmen, and revolutionaries\". I'm very certain in this case that, you know, I felt great when I thought of saying it in this other way. Makes it better. \n \nJoseph Langland\n00:52:47\nResumes reading \"The Jewish Cemetery in Leningrad\" by Joseph Brodsky.\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:54:03\nFor instance, the original translation was that this whole thing is \"one hour by foot FROM the nearest bus stop\" And as far as I'm concerned, saying \"to\" is apt, a crucial difference, \"and the crooked faces of the plywood\", see, \"are one hour by foot TO the nearest bus stop\". Wanted the whole sense that they might all get up and walk and haunt us, see, coming the other way. Here's a poem about conditions by Artyemy Mikhailov. These names may be just be relatively anonymous, although some of them are among the friends that have been defending Sinyavsky [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q468267] and Daniel [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q435770]. His idea about conditions. And it was a pretty rigid, stiff poem and I had to try to get movement in it and so forth. And it's whole, if, if you've, if your dearest friend has not been trapped and dragged to a camp, if, if, if, the entire way through.\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:55:01\nReads \u201cConditions\u201d by Artyemy Mikahilov [published later in Poetry from the Russian Underground].\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:56:07\nHere once again, there's so many of these, I just, here's one in the older style but it's one that's full of an elegant, lyric despair, \"Now that I know\", by Vladimir Kovshin.\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:56:21\nReads \"Now that I Know\" by Vladimir Kovshin [published later in Poetry from the Russian Underground].\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:57:01\nThis is a poem called \"After the War\" by Gleb Garbovsky. I just completed this this previous weekend, these I'm reading from now. \n \nJoseph Langland\n00:57:11\nReads \"After the War\" by Gleb Garbovsky [published later in Poetry from the Russian Underground].\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:58:54\nIncidentally, I used the phrase \"called back\" because that's on Emily Dickinson's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4441]  tomb in Amherst [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q49164], Massachusetts. Just an example of how you get your own little allegiance and locality into something else. \n \nJoseph Langland\n00:59:08\nResumes reading \"After the War\" by Gleb Garbovsky.\n \nJoseph Langland\n00:59:27\nHere's one, \"Keeping up with the Humanskys\". It's a poem about keeping up with the Joneses. [Audience laughter]. I had a lieutenant in the army who said his name was Humansky, and he said his, that man, I'll never forget it because he said that means \"son of the fields\" but I've been called worse names. I remember him saying that [audience laughter]. And so I...Son of the fields, I thought, that's great, you know, I was looking for a Russian name that would be like the Joneses, only this is like the serfs, son of the fields, of the soil. Couldn't be better. \"Keeping up with the Humanskys\". So, see, that's my good luck out of a little piece of experience that came to me when I needed it. \n \nJoseph Langland\n01:00:06\nReads \"Keeping up with the Humanskys\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:01:33\nThen there's one about a march from Russia to Siberia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5428]. And, \"Etape\". There's no title in the original, there's a footnote, which was, these were sent to Axel and Ticosz from Russia, this poem. Neither the name nor the fate of its author is known. The phrase \"Marching in Etape\" originates from the nineteenth century. One stretch of the Long March from Russia to Siberia was called Etape, and it was in a ballad stanza form, so that's the way I did it. It's...little old style, but.\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:02:07\nReads \"Etape\" by an unknown author.\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:03:57\nThen \"The Garbage Collector,\" a poem that...\n \nUnknown\n01:04:03\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n\nJoseph Langland\n01:04:04\nReads \"The Garbage Collector\u201d [begins abruptly; audience laughter throughout].\n \nAudience\n01:04:27\nLaughter.\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:04:30\nI'm very proud of that too, because you know in the old Renaissance things there's always these, an infinitely wise Christ Child, you know, at the mother's breast but his eyes are looking out elsewhere, and he's pointing like this, you know, and it's, so I thought, you know, that's not quite the translation but it's mine [audience laughter]. \n\nJoseph Langland\n01:04:46\nResumes reading \u201cThe Garbage Collector\u201d.\n\nJoseph Langland\n01:05:32\nWell, these are, you know, poems out of new, unknown--\n \nUnknown\n01:05:36\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:05:37\nI've sort of been threatening to sing something, and the trouble is, I'm...as I...I wouldn't play the piano if there were one here, and I don't play the guitar, and if I play this thing, it's locked stuff, I'm tied to it, and, I haven't played this tape that's accompanying me, you know, for at least three weeks, and I haven't sung a note since I left Amherst, except the notes I sang here, so, that's all right. These are songs of all sorts. So this is my accompaniment. I hope it works, if it doesn't I'll just stop it. \n \nUnknown\n01:06:17\nAmbient Sound [music; recorded track]. \n \nJoseph Langland\n01:06:22\nListen here, just a song called \"All the Lovers that You Ever Knew\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:06:37\nPerforms \"All the Lovers that You Ever Knew\" [published later in Any Body\u2019s Song] accompanied by recorded track.\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:08:02\nThis next is a song called \"Alone the Evening Falls on Me\". Sometimes I wonder, just trying to remember it here, whether I'm supposed to start singing now, and I'll get to the end of the song and I won't have accompaniment for the last dance. [Audience laughter].\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:08:31\nPerforms \"Alone the Evening Falls on Me\" accompanied by recorded track [published later as \"Song At Evening\u201d in Any Body\u2019s Song and collected in Selected Poems] \n \nJoseph Langland\n01:10:23\nThis is a song called \"Jump on my Back\". It's about Iowa and Wyoming. But since Wyoming didn't work, I had to say Idaho [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1221]. [Audience laughter].\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:10:45\nPerforms \"Jump on my Back\" accompanied by recorded track.\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:11:25\nThis next one is called \"A Hiroshima Lullaby\". There's an infinitely sad story. In Hiroshima [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q34664] when the bomb fell, in 1945, there was a little girl, Sadako Sasaki [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q231997], two years old, some of you may know of her. She was a mile and a half from the centre of the blast and apparently unharmed. She was a very gay and popular girl, and her classmates loved her. And she was in the sixth grade or the equivalent, age twelve, in Hiroshima, Hiroshima, however you pronounce it.  And she developed leukemia, which is of course, as many of you know, a latent effect of many people exposed to radiation, so she was, after all, a victim. And she, well she finally became so ill she had to go to the hospital. And her friends came to visit her. And among other things, they told her, and that she knew, that there's an old Japanese legend about herons. I've been writing poem about herons and cranes and I have some in my book, one on a sandhill crane, and I told some people today that I'm going to the University of Oregon [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q766145] in June to speak in their summer Academy of the Arts, and I heard of a person who works in wildlife out in Oregon [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q824], and so because of the poem about the crane he's invited me to visit his wildlife refuge, about two or three hours east of Eugene [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q171224], where he has a refuge among other things for sandhill cranes, you know these water birds are simple. And so I'm going to visit him. I look forward to it. Not because of a poem, see, it's nice. And so, Sadako Sasaki in the hospital, she heard that if you fold a thousand paper cranes in this Japanese folding technique, this will protect your health and save you. So she started folding them. And the tale has two sides. She reached 964 and she died. Her classmates were so, at the centre so involved they completed the thousand, they formed them in a chain. They went around gathering the equivalent of pennies, around Japan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q17], and when they got enough they asked a sculptor from Tokyo [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1490] to make a statue of this girl, and so he made a statue showing...you'll surely see pictures of this if you haven't. It's a young, twelve year-old girl, you know, still with a girl's body, she's standing up like this....and she stands in the Peace Park in Hiroshima now. And over her, made out of gold, the folded crane. And so, I wanted to write a poem for her. And so just using the fifth in the bass, and then using the five notes, black keys, I wrote a little ballad and I'll probably sing one stanza maybe, and then read the rest. \n \nJoseph Langland\n01:15:03\nPerforms the beginning of \"A Hiroshima Lullaby\" [published later in Any Body\u2019s Song and collected in Selected Poems].\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:15:38\nReads the continuation of \u201cA Hiroshima Lullaby\" [published later in Any Body\u2019s Song and collected in Selected Poems].\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:16:49\nI wanted to write a civil rights song, something that you could march to in Madison Square Garden [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q186125]. And that's, you know, it's a marching song. That's like that. \n \nJoseph Langland\n01:17:15\nPerforms unnamed song accompanied by recorded track. \n \nJoseph Langland\n01:18:00\nStops recorded track. \n \nJoseph Langland\n01:18:00\nWell, there are a lot more of these songs and I'm just going to stop the tape at this time because...I haven't even begun reading you my favourite poems, [audience laughter], and I know it's about to end but maybe, maybe I can read for fifteen minutes or so. If you have to go, just get up and go. But. When I was in Italy in 1954, I read in Marcus Cunliffe's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6758114] The Literature of the United States, \"New York is the intellectual centre of the United States.\"  That made my blood boil [audience laughter] because it's a marketplace, so I just simply took his own book, The Literature of the United States, took all his authors, and lined them up, and all the places where they were born, where they grew up, and where they wrote from, and sent them the chart, which proves, out of his own book, that in literature, creative ideas, there have been three great centres and then two subordinate ones. New England [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q18389], the Midwest, and the South, and then as subordinate ones, they're the West Coast, and then the mid-Atlantic, New York area. That's in literature [audience laughter]. And we got in an argument...the result of it all was that I invited him to come and teach at my university [audience laughter]. So he came and he gave an address, and in one of his speeches he said, \u201cAmericans are overly given to haruspication and scrying\u201d [audience laughter]. Well, you know, when someone comes out of England [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q21] and says, gives, delivers a lecture to an American audience and says that, among other things you have to look up the words. [Audience laughter]. And, so...so I looked them up and I discovered \"haruspication\", the Haruspects were Roman and Etruscan pagan priests who examined the entrails of sacrificial animals [audience laughter] to predict natural phenomena and the future. So I started thinking about that. I grew up on a general farm, we had about a hundred pigs, two hundred sheep, a hundred head of cattle, twenty milk cows, a thousand chickens, about one hundred turkeys, twelve goats, you know [audience laughter], anywhere from twenty to fifty cats, and all sorts of wild animals, and I had seen bulls gored to death, I had seen flocks of sheep driven over limestone cliffs by dogs, I'd seen hawks that'd ripped little lambs and chickens, I'd seen skunks that had eaten them up, I'd butchered all of these things, I'd castrated, you know, I myself have castrated maybe three thousand pigs, and [laughter]..and...so, I thought okay. In fact, some of you may know that \"The Wheel of Summer\", the title poem, is about the castration of one hundred pigs, by three teenage boys [audience laughter], and as I was introduced in England once, he said it's probably the most distinguished poem in English about the castration of a hundred pigs. [Audience laughter]. But I started thinking about all of this and I thought, well, okay, I have a philosophy of life too, and it's been based with the whole business of producing food for you. You know, that's the end of it, the end of it all. And I participated in an awful lot of killing and...routine, it\u2019s a way of life. And you know, if you eat meat, well you too. So I said, well okay, I've been haruspicating for a long time. And I gradually went up from age six to age eighteen, and meantime I achieved some kind of maturity, and I'm going to write my own poems. So I wrote all these poems, and the titles are, you know, like \"Sacrifice of a Rainbow Trout\", \"Sacrifice of My Pet Lamb\", but I'm going to read you the ultimate titles, which aren't in the book. Just running from age six on up to age eighteen, or when we got all old enough and we all went off to the war, as the last poem said.  But these say, you know, that's what these poems are really about.  \n \nJoseph Langland\n01:22:38\n\"The Clarity of Innocence: Sacrifice of a Trout\". \u201cThe Loss of Early Innocence: Sacrifice of My Pet Lamb\". \"The Plunder of Idealism: Sacrifice of the Golden Owl\". \"The Sickle among the Flowers\"...I quit making the equation...\"The Sickle Among the Flowers\". \"The Decline of Heroic Voices\"--that's the goring to death of a bull. \"The Suffocations of Love\"--that's the killing a pet chick by over-affection. \"The Attritions of Man\". \"The Unhousing of Beneficent God\". \"The Seeming, the Necessary and Beneficial Perversions of Love\"--that's my sacrifice of a gunny sack of cats. \"The Subtleties of Violent Revenge: Sacrifice of an old Sow\". \"The Sweet Solace of Evil\". \"The Absurdities of Fact\". \"The Pitfalls of Group Action: Sacrifice of a Flock of Sheep\"--they ran over this cliff, twelve of them died at once, and people say you shouldn't write villanelles, but that's the way sheep act, so I wrote a villanelle, you know, they repeat. \"The Catechism of Human Culpability\"--that's Eric, a suicide of a man. \"The Oddities of Affection\". \"The Sacred Violence of Purity\". \"The Bounties of Natural Law\". \"The Winter of the Cold War: Sacrifice of a Grey Wolf\". \"The Decline of Natural Instincts: Sacrifice of Three Wild Geese\". \"The Tyranny of Fixed Ideas\"--that's a sacrifice of a red squirrel. \"A Dream of the Ultimate Holocaust: Sacrifice of a Hill of Ants\" and \"The Warfare of the Sensuous Past: Sacrifice of My Aunt Marie\".  And then it all culminates in the longer narrative poem, \"The Wheel of Summer\". Which is just simply coming to maturity as a man. Well I'll, I'll read a few of these. \"Sacrifice of a Rainbow Trout\" has no music, but I oftentimes start singing when I'm reading it, but I'm not going to now, I've done that. \n \nJoseph Langland\n01:24:43\n\"Suddenly\"--this is six years old, you know.\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:24:46\nReads \"Sacrifice of a Rainbow Trout\" [from The Wheel of Summer and collected later in Selected Poems].\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:25:42\nI'll skip the lamb and read the owl. I wanted to just talk--\"We strung our wind-up rooster dead on a post\"--see, it can't be any flatter than that. \n \nJoseph Langland\n01:25:52\nReads \"Sacrifice of the Golden Owl\" [from The Wheel of Summer and later collected in Selected Poems].\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:27:39\nI'll read the one of the neighbors. No one can live on a, in a farm area without seeing over a period of years, people lose fingers, toes, arms, legs, in various ways. It's...I was on a reading tour, actually, when Kennedy [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q9696] was killed. And I was actually in an auditorium about to start reading these poems, when it was cancelled, because of the announced death of the president. I couldn't have read them, but I didn't know what I was going to do. I was just sitting there, and five minutes from starting time. But this is \"Sacrifice of my Neighbors\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:28:20\nReads \"Sacrifice of my Neighbors\" [from The Wheel of Summer].\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:28:39\nThat was my brother.\n\nJoseph Langland\n01:28:42\nResumes reading \u201cSacrifice of my Neighbors\u201d.\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:31:02\n\"Sacrifice of the Gunnysack of Cats\". I read it in New York City, I didn't know that the officers of the Society for the Friends of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals were sitting in the audience. After I went back to Amherst I got a letter from them, saying that every year there are twenty-five million unwanted pets born in the United States [audience laughter] and we secure funds to get the females spayed and the males castrated, and your poem, \"The Sacrifice of the Gunnysack of Cats\" is perfect for our purposes for our annual appeal, and, could we...[audience laughter.]..could we use it, please. I thought, my God, you know, I just, I read this poem, like all of these things out of a great affection, and this is the thing, you'll have to forgive me but this is what occurred to me, you know. I just had this great affectionate conception of the whole thing, and now they wanted to turn it into a kind of contraceptive. [Audience laughter]. And...and then I thought, well, okay, what can I do at this point? And so, showing this charming little picture, you know, it's a dog, and a little puppy dog [audience laughter], little kitten and laying their heads against each other and saying \"Annual Appeal\" and on the back of it was my \"Sacrifice of the Gunnysack of Cats\" and...I, you know, when I travel around the United States even now, I often like wonder in what town did I do in this poor little male cat or this female, you know, cooperating in one way or another, it's like, you know, I have to refuse to pay your taxes...you don't know what you're maiming at a certain point. But that's an example. I wanted to start from the most ordinary thing and see how I could carry it, and this is the \"Sacrifice of the Gunnysack of Cats\".\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:33:13\nReads \"Sacrifice of the Gunnysack of Cats\" [from The Wheel of Summer and collected later in Selected Poems].\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:36:23\nOne hard poem about the old sow, which is, says something about this world. \n \nJoseph Langland\n01:36:31\nReads \"Sacrifice of an Old Sow\" [from The Wheel of Summer and later collected in Selected Poems].\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:37:48\nWell that's the way we do it. Then one, pretty hard poem, too, it's about Eric, but it's really about us, and then I'll read the squirrel poem, and then leave these alone. That...okay, actually this, I had in mind an uncle, a favourite uncle. Very talented, frustrated.\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:38:19\nReads [\"The Sacrifice of Eric\u201d from The Wheel of Summer and collected later in Selected Poems].\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:41:09\nAlright, and then the squirrel. Actually, I...last week, I had a letter from some fellow in Kansas [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1558], I never, of course I don't know him at all. He wants to set the thing to music, I don't know what he's going to do with it, but...he plays the guitar, and so I said, fine. And just about anybody who gets caught in a rut...I must say that after this I'm going to read one little ballad on Adlai Stevenson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q311719], but...\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:41:47\nReads [\"The Sacrifice of a Red Squirrel\" from The Wheel of Summer]. \n \nJoseph Langland\n01:44:25\nLittle ballad for Stevenson, and I don't have it with me, but I know it. The state tree, bird, and flower of Illinois [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1204] is the oak, the cardinal, and the violet. That's green, red, and violet. It struck me, that's half a rainbow. That seemed like Adlai Stevens' life. A great theoretical life, unfinished, has to be completed by someone else. I asked, what's the other half, they're yellow, orange, and blue, and his home at Libertyville [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1787181], Illinois, you can't improve on that for the title, \"Libertyville\", it has a river the Des Plaines River [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q8637], that's before it enters the Chicago [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1297] drainage system, it's a nice blue stream out of the Wisconsin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1537] woods, that's blue, the sky is blue, the light by day is orange, and by night yellow. That's the full rainbow. \"There's a fountain in the wood\"...It's called \"Libertyville\" and past that, a little epigraph about the state tree, bird, and flower of Illinois, and I wanted to, for the schoolchildren of Illinois...\n \nJoseph Langland\n01:45:27\nReads \"Libertyville\" [from The Wheel of Summer and collected later in Selected Poems].\n \nAudience\n01:47:02\nApplause.\n \nEND\n01:47:35\n",

Star is a four letter word, s-t-a-r. Now, in case I read, I--is this on right? In case I read something here tonight with a four letter word in it, which I'm liable to cause I might start off be reading part of The Beard, um, [unintelligible] if anyone would be offended, it would be a good thing if they got their money back, right now. It's their right to do so.\n\nAudience\n00:01:07\nApplause.\n\nMichael McClure\n00:01:22\nThe Beard is a poem of mine in the form of a play that's just been arrested fifteen nights in a row by Los Angeles [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q65] police and a state law has been passed against it being performed in the state colleges in California [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q99]. These are the trials and tribulations. And right now we're waiting for a panel of three federal judges to come and see it and decide if it has redeeming special significance. [Audience laughter]. And if they don't think it is, we'll take it to the Supreme Court [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q11201] and see what they think. And, the play has two characters in it, Billy the Kid [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q44200] and Jean Harlow [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q105719]. And they're together in a blue velvet eternity, they both are wearing little beards made out of torn white tissue paper. They're--they only thing on the set with them is a table and two chairs covered with furs and Harlow is wearing a blue gown and she has a purse with her and a mirror and the Kid is dressed in a costume appropriate to his costume--I mean appropriate to his career. And when the curtain opens, there's an orange light shining on him which goes up after the first, about the first thirty seconds. And being that this is a poem in the form of a play, I can only read it, I can't read it properly, I can't be two people, I can't be Billy the Kid and Jean Harlow I can only be the author so I'll have to read it that way where it's actually meant to be a poem and acted by me on a stage, on a shelf with lights. We have a shelf with lights, but that's the best I can do.\n \nMichael McClure\n00:03:41\nReads selection from The Beard.\n\nAudience\n00:10:29\nApplause.\n \nMichael McClure\n00:11:02\nUm, I'm going to read two more tonight. I want to read for a while and then have an intermission and then I'd like to come back on and play some musical pieces that my music guru George Montana has been working on with me and we've been writing some songs together, but I'd like to read poems for maybe half an hour or so first. I want to read some poems called \"Mad Sonnets\" and I imagine a lot of you know what sons are, what known as sons are, fourteen lines with a legitimate rhyme scheme, and these are not quite exactly like that...Does this microphone sound right? If I stand right here is that okay so that I don't have to lean into it?\n \nMichael McClure\n00:12:25\nReads \"Mad Sonnet\" [from Star].\n \nMichael McClure\n00:14:08\nAnother \"Mad Sonnet\", kind of ecological.\n \nMichael McClure\n00:14:23\nReads [\"Mad Sonnet 3\" from Star].\n \nMichael McClure\n00:16:03\nHere's a--I live in San Francisco [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q62], but here's a \"Mad Sonnet\" that I started in New York [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60], I went to Wall Street [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q11690] on a Saturday morning, I guess you can imagine what it's like during the weekdays, it's a narrow street, buildings stretching up like cliffs on each side of them and on Saturday morning it's cold and empty and you can feel the crush and vibrations from the previous part of the week.\n \nMichael McClure\n00:16:32\nReads [\u201cMad Sonnet 13\u201d from Star, published later as \u201cCold Saturday Mad Sonnet\u201d in Selected Poems].\n \nMichael McClure\n00:17:58\nI never thought of those signs--they told me I can't smoke up here. It's my life. I'll do what I want, [unintelligible]. [Audience laughter]. The work--I think-are we all, I think I'm waiting for, this technology with which we live in, which is wonderful enough in it's own way, is also costly and [unintelligible], eating up the planet, and I think I'm waiting for an all-chemical science, by means in which we can manifest ourselves through the universe and I guess we'll have to tinker toys like rocket ships and space ships to begin it, but I don't think that's how we'll really do it. And it's become kind of tradition to write songs to science, so I guess I had to do one too.\n \nMichael McClure\n00:19:20\nReads [\u201cMad Sonnet 5\u201d from Star].\n \nMichael McClure\n00:20:48\nI've got a book of poems in a language I call Beast Language, they're about half in English and half in this invented language. The book is called Ghost Tantras, ghost like the German word \"gist\", g-i-s-t, which means spirit, and I just said \"ghost\". Why can't ghost be a spirit, why can't we use that in English? And tantra, t-a-n-t-r-a, which is a Hindu form of poetry, it's poetry written in an invented language for magical purposes to bring about changes in the universe. I felt these poems, I felt these poems coming on, and I felt like I had a ball of silence within myself, within my body and I heard these sounds within that ball of silence, and I wrote them down phonetically, so kind of like Marvel comics [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q173496], you know where it says \"keee\" or \"rash\", k-e-e-e, or r-a-s-h. And I see later that things like this have been done in gnostic Bizantine chants too, which also, is like Marvel comics. \"Ka-pow\". And some of them were written in San Francisco, some of them were written in airplanes, on the way to Mexico [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q96]. I was going to Mexico to bring back cultures of [unintelligible] Mexicana, the sacred [salsavie (?)] mushroom which were grown by scientists in Brooklyn [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q18419]. And, then upon my return I finished from there. I finished these \"Mad Sonnets\", there are 99 of them and I don't think you've probably heard anything like them before, and I guess all you can do is just relax. I like to start with one that starts with English because it's not so strange, they're about a third English or half English maybe.\n \nMichael McClure\n00:23:15\nBegins to perform unnamed sound poem.\n \nMichael McClure\n00:23:19\nNo, that's not it...Where'd George go? George? [Audience laughter].\n \nMichael McClure\n00:24:00\nPerforms \u201cGhost Tantra #51\u201d [published later in Ghost Tantras].\n \nMichael McClure\n00:25:42\nHere's another one that starts in English, it starts in Spanish. Just went to Spanish, [unintelligible] George is.\n \nMichael McClure\n00:25:57\nPerforms \u201cGhost Tantra #54\u201d [published later in Ghost Tantras].\n \nMichael McClure\n00:27:45\nI just had a lot of microphone trouble in Buffalo [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q40435] too. I don't know what. It's alright?\n \nMichael McClure\n00:27:55\nPerforms \u201cGhost Tantra #69\u201d [published later in Ghost Tantras].\n \nMichael McClure\n00:29:45\nHere's one, this was written the day after Marilyn Monroe [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4616] died, August 6, 1962.\n \nMichael McClure\n00:30:11\nReads \"Ghost Tantra #39\" [published later in Ghost Tantras].\n \nMichael McClure\n00:31:37\nYou've got a tourist card in the back of the room [(?)] Is everybody relaxed? Cause I'm not. Eddie in [unintelligible] was dismissed recently and I guess this poem had something to do with it. And, the poem is the ending of, it's the sexual ending of a very long poem called \"Dark Brown\" I see nothing wrong in taking any sexual part of the poem from any other part of the poem, and the sexual writing today will be viewed in fifty years or a hundred years much the way we view nature poetry today in the 19th century, because some [unintelligible] classes we kept bringing up the fact that for our [unintelligible] today if you were to look at the atmosphere or the air we breathe, the primary part of our environment is either other human bodies or concrete and we choose human bodies rather than the concrete which seems to be a pretty good choice. I think that given the changes that are going on today, I believe we won't be able to say anything. If we can say anything now. If we can say anything anytime but I mean, I think this will be looked upon as [unintelligible] Nature poetry, Shelley [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q93343] and Keats [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q82083]were pulling cockney school in their day, which of course was all there is for Shelley since he was a [unintelligible] and probably some of Keats although it was worse since he was a cockney. [Audience laughter]. They were insulted for their new nature poetries, and this too. I'd like to read some like, preliminary stanzas of that poem, and then read part of the longer section which seems to have to do with the [unintelligible]. In Eddie's defense I'll say that the London Times [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q50008] literary supplement found that this is [unintelligible]. The poem is written in independent stanzas, I'd like to think of the stanzas as being independent in the way an organism is, and the totality of the poem in the totality in a way an--the way a primitive--and this is a primitive organism is comprised of [unintelligible] individuals to make up its [unintelligible] of being. The poem is called \"Dark Brown\" and I've just opened it to the page I wanted to. The stanza I wanted to.\n \nMichael McClure\n00:35:21\nReads \"Dark Brown\" from Dark Brown.\n \nMichael McClure\n00:37:48\nReads [\"The black black black damned and undreamy odem the undersoul\" from Dark Brown].\n \nMichael McClure\n00:40:00\nAnother poem. Okay, have I justified enough? Now's your chance to go home. I'm going to read the tough part.\n \nMichael McClure\n00:40:23\nReads [\u201cFuck Ode\u201d from Dark Brown].\n \nAudience\n00:50:00\nApplause.\n \nMichael McClure\n00:50:15\nI'll take a break. George and I are going to play, George Montana and I, and I won't guarantee anything about it as my fingers are feeling very clumsy tonight. I'll be playing an instrument but I know George will play for us, so if you hear any faults in the playing, it's me not George. I want to take like, at least, I want to take a ten minute break and anybody who'd like to stay is welcome to stay, and if you'd like to go, go, and if you want to leave during the music if you don't like the music for god's sake go. Thank you. \n \nUnknown\n00:51:09\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n \nMichael McClure\n00:51:12\nI'm kind of nervous, us going through it again.\n \nGeorge Montana\n00:51:19\n[IUnintelligible].\n \nMichael McClure\n00:51:23\nSure, let's see if it picks up.\n \nGeorge Montana\n00:51:24\nI think it's picking up\n \nMichael McClure\n00:51:25\nYeah?\n \nGeorge Montana\n00:51:26\nYeah.\n \nMichael McClure\n00:51:27\nCan you hear us whispering?\n \nAudience\n00:51:28\nYes.\n \nUnknown\n00:51:30\nAmbient Sound [music].\n \nMichael McClure\n00:51:41\nLet's see what it sounds like.\n \nMichael McClure\n00:51:43\nIs it picking up?

Why don't you tell them?\n \nGeorge Montana\n01:02:07\nThis is a song that Michael and I just have done, so I don't know the words by heart yet. So here it is.\n \nMichael McClure\n01:02:19\nAnd I haven't learned this melody very well yet. Let's get coordinated together. You set the [unintelligible].

McClure met his first wife, Joanna Kinnison, and married her in 1954. They later had one daughter, Katherine Jane (b. 1956), but divorced in 1986. While at San Francisco State College, he took a course with poet Robert Duncan, and was influenced by Charles Olson, William Blake and Walt Whitman\u2019s poetries as well as Jackson Pollock\u2019s paintings. McClure received instant fame when he participated in the infamous Six Gallery poetry reading in San Francisco with Allen Ginsberg, Philip Whalen, Gary Snyder and Philip Lamantia. McClure was thus associated with the Beat movement, and began publishing in what became a prolific writing career. In 1956, with poet and publisher Jonathan Williams and James Harmon, McClure published the work of both Black Mountain school poets and San Francisco Beat poets in Ark II\/Moby I review; it was published in 1957. Jonathan Williams then published McClure\u2019s first book of poetry, Passage (Jargon Book Series, 1956). McClure subsequently published many collections of poetry, including For Artaud (Totem Press, 1959), Hymns to St. Geryon and Other Poems (Auerhahn Press, 1959), Dark Brown (Auerhahn Press, 1961), The New Book\/ A Book of Torture (Grove Press, 1961), Meat Science Essays (City Lights Books, 1963), Love Lion Lioness (Privately printed, 1963), Ghost Tantras (Privately printed, 1964), 13 Mad Sonnets (Privately printed, 1965), The Beard (Several publishers between 1965-7), The Sermons of Jean Harlow and the Curses of Billy the Kid (Four Seasons press, 1968), The Mammals (Cranium Press, 1972), Jaguar Skies (New Directions, 1975), Scratching the Beat Surface (North Point Press, 1982), Selected Poems (New Directions, 1986), and Rebel Lions (New Directions, 1991). McClure also wrote many plays, including !The Feast! (San Francisco, Batman Gallery, 22 December 1960), The Blossom; or Billy the Kid (New York, American Theatre for Poets, 1964), the controversial play The Beard (San Francisco, Encore Theatre, Encore Theare, December 18, 1965), Gorf (San Francisco, Magic Theare,1976) and Josephine the Mouse Singer (New York, WPA Theatre, November 20, 1978), recipient of two Off-Broadway Theatre Awards. In 1963, McClure became a professor at the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland, California, where he taught for more than 40 years, eventually becoming a professor emeritus. McClure was awarded numerous honours, including grants from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1967 and 1974, a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1974, a Pushcart Prize for Poetry in 1991 and a Lifetime Achievement Poetry Award from the National Poetry Society in 1993. More recently, McClure published Simple Eyes (New Directions, 1992), Love Lion Video (with Ray Manzarek, Mystic Fire Video, 1993), The Mad Club (Blue Moon Books, 1995), Rain Mirror (New Directions, 1999),  There\u2019s a Word! audio recording with Ray Manzarek (Rare Angel Music 2001), and Plum Stones: Cartoons of No Heaven (O Books, 2002). In 1997, McClure married a sculptor, Amy Evans. Michael McClure continues to perform and write from the San Francisco Bay Area"

Star is a four letter word, s-t-a-r. Now, in case I read, I--is this on right? In case I read something here tonight with a four letter word in it, which I'm liable to cause I might start off be reading part of The Beard, um, [unintelligible] if anyone would be offended, it would be a good thing if they got their money back, right now. It's their right to do so.\n\nAudience\n00:01:07\nApplause.\n\nMichael McClure\n00:01:22\nThe Beard is a poem of mine in the form of a play that's just been arrested fifteen nights in a row by Los Angeles [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q65] police and a state law has been passed against it being performed in the state colleges in California [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q99]. These are the trials and tribulations. And right now we're waiting for a panel of three federal judges to come and see it and decide if it has redeeming special significance. [Audience laughter]. And if they don't think it is, we'll take it to the Supreme Court [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q11201] and see what they think. And, the play has two characters in it, Billy the Kid [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q44200] and Jean Harlow [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q105719]. And they're together in a blue velvet eternity, they both are wearing little beards made out of torn white tissue paper. They're--they only thing on the set with them is a table and two chairs covered with furs and Harlow is wearing a blue gown and she has a purse with her and a mirror and the Kid is dressed in a costume appropriate to his costume--I mean appropriate to his career. And when the curtain opens, there's an orange light shining on him which goes up after the first, about the first thirty seconds. And being that this is a poem in the form of a play, I can only read it, I can't read it properly, I can't be two people, I can't be Billy the Kid and Jean Harlow I can only be the author so I'll have to read it that way where it's actually meant to be a poem and acted by me on a stage, on a shelf with lights. We have a shelf with lights, but that's the best I can do.\n \nMichael McClure\n00:03:41\nReads selection from The Beard.\n\nAudience\n00:10:29\nApplause.\n \nMichael McClure\n00:11:02\nUm, I'm going to read two more tonight. I want to read for a while and then have an intermission and then I'd like to come back on and play some musical pieces that my music guru George Montana has been working on with me and we've been writing some songs together, but I'd like to read poems for maybe half an hour or so first. I want to read some poems called \"Mad Sonnets\" and I imagine a lot of you know what sons are, what known as sons are, fourteen lines with a legitimate rhyme scheme, and these are not quite exactly like that...Does this microphone sound right? If I stand right here is that okay so that I don't have to lean into it?\n \nMichael McClure\n00:12:25\nReads \"Mad Sonnet\" [from Star].\n \nMichael McClure\n00:14:08\nAnother \"Mad Sonnet\", kind of ecological.\n \nMichael McClure\n00:14:23\nReads [\"Mad Sonnet 3\" from Star].\n \nMichael McClure\n00:16:03\nHere's a--I live in San Francisco [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q62], but here's a \"Mad Sonnet\" that I started in New York [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60], I went to Wall Street [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q11690] on a Saturday morning, I guess you can imagine what it's like during the weekdays, it's a narrow street, buildings stretching up like cliffs on each side of them and on Saturday morning it's cold and empty and you can feel the crush and vibrations from the previous part of the week.\n \nMichael McClure\n00:16:32\nReads [\u201cMad Sonnet 13\u201d from Star, published later as \u201cCold Saturday Mad Sonnet\u201d in Selected Poems].\n \nMichael McClure\n00:17:58\nI never thought of those signs--they told me I can't smoke up here. It's my life. I'll do what I want, [unintelligible]. [Audience laughter]. The work--I think-are we all, I think I'm waiting for, this technology with which we live in, which is wonderful enough in it's own way, is also costly and [unintelligible], eating up the planet, and I think I'm waiting for an all-chemical science, by means in which we can manifest ourselves through the universe and I guess we'll have to tinker toys like rocket ships and space ships to begin it, but I don't think that's how we'll really do it. And it's become kind of tradition to write songs to science, so I guess I had to do one too.\n \nMichael McClure\n00:19:20\nReads [\u201cMad Sonnet 5\u201d from Star].\n \nMichael McClure\n00:20:48\nI've got a book of poems in a language I call Beast Language, they're about half in English and half in this invented language. The book is called Ghost Tantras, ghost like the German word \"gist\", g-i-s-t, which means spirit, and I just said \"ghost\". Why can't ghost be a spirit, why can't we use that in English? And tantra, t-a-n-t-r-a, which is a Hindu form of poetry, it's poetry written in an invented language for magical purposes to bring about changes in the universe. I felt these poems, I felt these poems coming on, and I felt like I had a ball of silence within myself, within my body and I heard these sounds within that ball of silence, and I wrote them down phonetically, so kind of like Marvel comics [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q173496], you know where it says \"keee\" or \"rash\", k-e-e-e, or r-a-s-h. And I see later that things like this have been done in gnostic Bizantine chants too, which also, is like Marvel comics. \"Ka-pow\". And some of them were written in San Francisco, some of them were written in airplanes, on the way to Mexico [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q96]. I was going to Mexico to bring back cultures of [unintelligible] Mexicana, the sacred [salsavie (?)] mushroom which were grown by scientists in Brooklyn [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q18419]. And, then upon my return I finished from there. I finished these \"Mad Sonnets\", there are 99 of them and I don't think you've probably heard anything like them before, and I guess all you can do is just relax. I like to start with one that starts with English because it's not so strange, they're about a third English or half English maybe.\n \nMichael McClure\n00:23:15\nBegins to perform unnamed sound poem.\n \nMichael McClure\n00:23:19\nNo, that's not it...Where'd George go?

Just went to Spanish, [unintelligible] George is.\n \nMichael McClure\n00:25:57\nPerforms \u201cGhost Tantra #54\u201d [published later in Ghost Tantras].\n \nMichael McClure\n00:27:45\nI just had a lot of microphone trouble in Buffalo [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q40435] too. I don't know what. It's alright?\n \nMichael McClure\n00:27:55\nPerforms \u201cGhost Tantra #69\u201d [published later in Ghost Tantras].\n \nMichael McClure\n00:29:45\nHere's one, this was written the day after Marilyn Monroe [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4616] died, August 6, 1962.\n \nMichael McClure\n00:30:11\nReads \"Ghost Tantra #39\" [published later in Ghost Tantras].\n \nMichael McClure\n00:31:37\nYou've got a tourist card in the back of the room [(?)] Is everybody relaxed? Cause I'm not. Eddie in [unintelligible] was dismissed recently and I guess this poem had something to do with it. And, the poem is the ending of, it's the sexual ending of a very long poem called \"Dark Brown\" I see nothing wrong in taking any sexual part of the poem from any other part of the poem, and the sexual writing today will be viewed in fifty years or a hundred years much the way we view nature poetry today in the 19th century, because some [unintelligible] classes we kept bringing up the fact that for our [unintelligible] today if you were to look at the atmosphere or the air we breathe, the primary part of our environment is either other human bodies or concrete and we choose human bodies rather than the concrete which seems to be a pretty good choice. I think that given the changes that are going on today, I believe we won't be able to say anything. If we can say anything now. If we can say anything anytime but I mean, I think this will be looked upon as [unintelligible] Nature poetry, Shelley [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q93343] and Keats [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q82083]were pulling cockney school in their day, which of course was all there is for Shelley since he was a [unintelligible] and probably some of Keats although it was worse since he was a cockney. [Audience laughter]. They were insulted for their new nature poetries, and this too. I'd like to read some like, preliminary stanzas of that poem, and then read part of the longer section which seems to have to do with the [unintelligible]. In Eddie's defense I'll say that the London Times [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q50008] literary supplement found that this is [unintelligible]. The poem is written in independent stanzas, I'd like to think of the stanzas as being independent in the way an organism is, and the totality of the poem in the totality in a way an--the way a primitive--and this is a primitive organism is comprised of [unintelligible] individuals to make up its [unintelligible] of being. The poem is called \"Dark Brown\" and I've just opened it to the page I wanted to. The stanza I wanted to.\n \nMichael McClure\n00:35:21\nReads \"Dark Brown\" from Dark Brown.\n \nMichael McClure\n00:37:48\nReads [\"The black black black damned and undreamy odem the undersoul\" from Dark Brown].\n \nMichael McClure\n00:40:00\nAnother poem. Okay, have I justified enough? Now's your chance to go home. I'm going to read the tough part.\n \nMichael McClure\n00:40:23\nReads [\u201cFuck Ode\u201d from Dark Brown].\n \nAudience\n00:50:00\nApplause.\n \nMichael McClure\n00:50:15\nI'll take a break. George and I are going to play, George Montana and I, and I won't guarantee anything about it as my fingers are feeling very clumsy tonight. I'll be playing an instrument but I know George will play for us, so if you hear any faults in the playing, it's me not George. I want to take like, at least, I want to take a ten minute break and anybody who'd like to stay is welcome to stay, and if you'd like to go, go, and if you want to leave during the music if you don't like the music for god's sake go.

We have Lionel Kearns [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6555690] and bpNichol [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4953105], as you know, and they have elected instead of doing a reading by each poet, with an intermission in the middle or anything like that, a manner of joint reading. And I think, in a sense, that makes a lot of sense, because Lionel Kearns is by one of his professions, a linguist, and also one of his main, one of his main themes is the social care of human beings. bpNichol is a radical therapist, and is known especially for his border-blur poems, and it makes a lot of sense, I think, for that reason that they do read together. They read together last night at Carleton [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1041737], apparently worked out very well. Lionel is as you probably know is one of the centres of the so-called Vancouver [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q24639]Renaissance that took over Canadian poetry in the 1960's, threatened to do that too [laughter]. bp was one of those blessed children from the east, although he had lived in Vancouver before, who kept his ears open. Well, he says he was born there. bp managed to grace the city of Vancouver for a few years and I guess that's where he got the ears open in the first place, but since that time he's been opening all our ears. So seeing as how this reading threatens to last four hours, according to rumours, I think I'll stop now and give the floor to either, and, or bpNichol and Lionel Kearns.\n \nLionel Kearns\n00:02:26\nWell, I'll begin by reading a poem called \"Telephone\".

I wrote it at Port Dover [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7230589], in, on Lake Erie [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5492]. It's one of those days when I was flaked out on the beach, covered up because I get vicious sunburns and just peel the whole summer, and in the background was playing \"(There\u2019ll Be Bluebirds) Over the white cliffs of Dover\" and \u201cWhat\u2019s New Pussycat\u201d sort of juxtaposed, there was sprawled over the beach was this weird phrase \"Podunk\" and these two cats were playing football overtop of my head. So anyways I felt very sort of, weird, and wrote the following poem.\n \nbpNichol\n00:27:25\nPerforms unnamed poem.\n \nbpNichol\n00:29:06\nHugo Ball [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q70989] was kind of the daddy of us all, and he was kind of a very fine dadaist who lived in Switzerland [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q39] during the first World War [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q361] and sort of did the first sound poems. It was very strange, if you read Hugo Ball's diaries, it's rather fascinating because it was more or less, when he gave these sort of his final public reading he got really carried away in the midst of a sound poem an kind of got thrown back into sort of a--how to put this--an earlier space in his mind, anyways he went back and started remembering all sorts of things right back through his life doing this sound poem. As you read the diaries, there's a real feeling he became totally terrified of what was happening to him. Because at that point he then just split and left the whole thing behind. So this is kind of for Hugo Ball. It's called \"Dada Lama\". This poem's gone through so many changes I can't even keep track of it anymore.\n \nbpNichol\n00:30:28\nReads [sections of Dada Lama: a sound sequence in six parts, collected later in Selected Writing: As Elected]. \n \nLionel Kearns\n00:33:38\nI'm going to read some poems now from my collection, Pointing, which I see is for sale out on the other room.

It's really a translation of a poem by Antonio Machado [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q243771], the Spanish poet. I've not only translated it, I've switched the central image, but used his statement. His image was that of a boat going across a lake and he looked out and saw the ripple of the water behind it and  then commented on that.

Some concrete poetry is purely visual and you can't read it, it's to go on walls and things like that. Other concrete poetry is so sonic that it's nothing really to look at, but occasionally you can get the two combined so that you have something on the page which also is something else when read, but the two correspond. This one that I've got is to some extent like that, on the page it's called \"Studies in Interior Decoration Border Design\" because of the way it looks on the page, which of course being an audience at a poetry reading, you aren't concerned with.

The original one was a Western made in Japan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q17], and Hollywood stole the idea and made a Western in the West.

And I called \"Ambergris, a Statement on Source\". Ambergris, being that stuff that sick whales cough up and which floats around on the ocean and it's very smelly stuff but it's very valuable stuff if you find it floating around because you can sell it for a great deal of money to perfume factories.

                "notes": "Canadian avant-garde poet bpNichol (Barrie Phillip) was born in Vancouver, British Columbia on September 30, 1944. Nichol spent his childhood in Vancouver, in Winnipeg, Manitoba and in Port Arthur, Ontario before returning to his birthplace in 1960. Although Nichol was writing by 1961, he enrolled into the education faculty at the University of British Columbia and received a teaching degree in 1963. At UBC, Nichol audited writing classes and met younger members of the Tish group. Then Nichol taught grade four students in Port and Coquitlam, B.C. for a year before moving to Toronto, where he worked as a book searcher for the University of Toronto and entered therapy with lay analyst Lea Hindley-Smith. In 1967, Nichol established the lay-therapy foundation and community Therafields, and served as an administrator and therapist until 1983. His first publication, a \u2018bp box\u2019 included Journeying & the returns (a book), Letters Home (visual poems), Borders (a record), Wild Thing (a flip book) and Statement (printed on the back of the box) was published by Coach House Press in 1967 was followed by a collection of concrete poetry, Konfessions of an Elizabethan Fan Dancer (Writer\u2019s Forum, 1967). Nichol began working with sound poetry in the mid-1960\u2019s, but also valued the textuality and visual materiality of words and books. Nichol collaborated with Steve McCaffery to found the Toronto Research Group through which they wrote and published essays on the materiality of writing, which were later collected in Rational Geomancy: The Kids of the Book Machine (1992). The duo also formed a sound poetry group, The Four Horsemen, with Rafael Barreto-Rivera and Paul Dutton. Nichol founded Ganglia Press in 1965, and started a series of pamphlets in 1969 called grOnk. Nichol also published The Complete Works (Ganglia, 1969), a package of booklets Still Water, The true eventual story of Billy the Kid, Beach head, and The cosmic chef (Talonbooks, 1970) which won a Governor General\u2019s Award for Poetry, ABC: the aleph beth book (Oberon Press, 1971), Monotons (Talonbooks, 1971), The Other Side of the Room (Weed\/Flower Press, 1971) and Two Novels (Coach House Press, 1969).  At this time, Nichol began writing his life-long serial long poem, The Martyrology Books 1 & 2 (Coach House Press, 1972), a series which Nichol published Books 3 and 4 (C.H.P., 1976), Book 5 (C.H.P., 1982), Book 6 (1987), after which Books 7-10 were published posthumously through Coach House Press. Nichols worked tirelessly as an unpaid volunteer for Coach House Press, and personally edited or acquired almost one quarter of the titles published during that time. Nichols was not only a poet, visual artist and editor, he wrote songs and scripts for the TV programs Fraggle Rocks and The Racoons, musical comedies Group (1980) and Tracks (1986), and the bestselling children\u2019s books ONCE: A Lullaby (Black Moss Press, 1983), Moosequakes and other disasters (Black Moss Press, 1981), The man who loved his knees (Black Moss Press, 1993) and To the end of the block (Black Moss Press, 1984). His later publications include Unit of four (Seripress, 1973), Zygal (Coach House Press, 1985), Selected organs: parts of an autobiography (Black Moss Press, 1988), Art Facts (Chax Press, 1990). Nichol appears in Michael Ondaatje\u2019s film, Sons of Captain Poetry (1970), bp: pushing the boundaries directed by Brian Nash (1997), Ron Mann\u2019s Poetry in Motion (1982). bpNichol died in Toronto on September 25, 1988. A street in the Annex district behind Coach House Press was named in his honour, with an eight-line poem by Nichol written into the pavement: \u201cA \/ LAKE \/ A \/ LANE \/ A \/ LINE \/ A \/ LONE\u201d."

                "notes": "Canadian poet Lionel Kearns was born in Nelson, British Columbia in 1937. His father, C.F. Kearns, a Great War flyer, outdoorsman and short-story author encouraged Kearns to pursue a literary career. In the mid 1950\u2019s, Kearns embarked on trip, traveling the world and even playing professional hockey in Mexico. Kearns then returned to B.C. and studied poetic theory and structural linguistics at the University of British Columbia, where he met and worked with George Bowering, Frank Davey and Fred Wah in the Tish collective. His M.A. thesis was published by Tishbooks as Songs of circumstance in 1962. His second publication, Listen, George (Imago Press, 1965) was a verse-letter to George Bowering about his youth, written while he was studying at the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London. Kearns was influenced by the European  concrete and sound poetry movements, and spent a year in Trinidad analyzing the West Indian English dialect. In 1966, upon returning to Canada, Kearns held a position at the English department at Simon Fraser University, which he held until 1986. His next publications include By the light of the silvery McLune: media parables, poems, signs, gestures and other assaults on the interface (The Daylight Press, 1969), Practicing up to be human (1978), Ignoring the bomb (1982), and his highly acclaimed book, Convergences (1984). Kearns was the writer-in-residence at Concordia University from 1982-3. Since 1986, Kearns created a continent-wide on-line graduate course, \u2018The Cybernetics of Poetry\u2019 for ConnecEd, the distance learning facility of the New York School for Social Research in New York, which he teaches from home. Interested in the electronic and online poetry potential, Kearns became the first writer-in-electronic-residence, assisting Trevor Owen establish the \u2018Wier\u2019 project, an on-line writing project."

We have Lionel Kearns [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6555690] and bpNichol [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4953105], as you know, and they have elected instead of doing a reading by each poet, with an intermission in the middle or anything like that, a manner of joint reading. And I think, in a sense, that makes a lot of sense, because Lionel Kearns is by one of his professions, a linguist, and also one of his main, one of his main themes is the social care of human beings. bpNichol is a radical therapist, and is known especially for his border-blur poems, and it makes a lot of sense, I think, for that reason that they do read together. They read together last night at Carleton [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1041737], apparently worked out very well. Lionel is as you probably know is one of the centres of the so-called Vancouver [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q24639]Renaissance that took over Canadian poetry in the 1960's, threatened to do that too [laughter]. bp was one of those blessed children from the east, although he had lived in Vancouver before, who kept his ears open. Well, he says he was born there. bp managed to grace the city of Vancouver for a few years and I guess that's where he got the ears open in the first place, but since that time he's been opening all our ears. So seeing as how this reading threatens to last four hours, according to rumours, I think I'll stop now and give the floor to either, and, or bpNichol and Lionel Kearns.\n \nLionel Kearns\n00:02:26\nWell, I'll begin by reading a poem called \"Telephone\". It's what I call a media parable, I have a whole set of poems that are media parables and things, which are coming out in a collection very soon. This one is called \"Telephone\".\n \nLionel Kearns\n00:02:49\nReads \"Telephone\" [from By the Light of the Silvery McLune: Media Parables, Poems, Signs, Gestures and other Assaults of the Interface; audience laughter throughout].\n \nbpNichol\n00:07:04\nWhat you're going to get out of me this evening is a strange pastiche, since I managed to do that clever thing of losing everything I wrote over the last year. So this is selected weirdness.\n \nbpNichol\n00:07:23\nReads [\u201cMonotones\u201d, part I from Gifts: The Martyrology Book(s) 7 &\u201d]. \n \nbpNichol\n00:08:45\nReads \"Uneven Song\". \n\nbpNichol\n00:09:28\nReads unnamed poem. \n \nLionel Kearns\n00:10:26\nReads \"Word\" [from By the Light of the Silvery McLune: Media Parables, Poems, Signs, Gestures and other Assaults of the Interface].\n \nLionel Kearns\n00:11:27\nI'll read a series of quiet poems. Because we've got some really loud ones to read too. \"Poem found among the ruins\".\n\nLionel Kearns\n00:11:43\nReads \"Poem found among the ruins\" [published as \u201cMedium\u201d in By the Light of the Silvery McLune: Media Parables, Poems, Signs, Gestures and other Assaults of the Interface].\n \nLionel Kearns\n00:12:19\nThis one's called \"The Business\".\n \nLionel Kearns\n00:12:24\nReads \"The Business\" [from By the Light of the Silvery McLune: Media Parables, Poems, Signs, Gestures and other Assaults of the Interface].\n \nLionel Kearns\n00:12:43\nThis one is called \"Genres\u201d.\n \nLionel Kearns\n00:12:45\nReads \"Genres\u201d [published as \u201cContent\u201d in By the Light of the Silvery McLune: Media Parables, Poems, Signs, Gestures and other Assaults of the Interface].\n \nLionel Kearns\n00:13:51\nReads \"The Answer\" [from By the Light of the Silvery McLune: Media Parables, Poems, Signs, Gestures and other Assaults of the Interface].\n \nLionel Kearns\n00:15:05\nAnd this one, derives from my seeing a piece of sculpture, an exhibition of Haida art I think, or some West Coast Indian art. A little figure of a woman carved, a carved figure of a woman, but she is in a very strange position, she's doing a kind of funny thing. It seemed worth writing a poem about. It's called \"Labio Digital\".

I'll try this one without the mic. It's called \"Gestured\u201d My titles are always very abstract. That's not very abstract [audience laughter]. Most of my titles are very abstract.

[Audience laughter]. This one is called \"Transport\", it's also a media parable.\n \nLionel Kearns\n00:22:56\nReads \"Transport\" [from By the Light of the Silvery McLune: Media Parables, Poems, Signs, Gestures and other Assaults of the Interface].\n\nUnknown\n00:26:32\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n \nbpNichol\n00:26:33\nThere's things that I try to be absolutely very, very personal [inaudible] thing I ever wrote. I wrote it at Port Dover [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7230589], in, on Lake Erie [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5492]. It's one of those days when I was flaked out on the beach, covered up because I get vicious sunburns and just peel the whole summer, and in the background was playing \"(There\u2019ll Be Bluebirds) Over the white cliffs of Dover\" and \u201cWhat\u2019s New Pussycat\u201d sort of juxtaposed, there was sprawled over the beach was this weird phrase \"Podunk\" and these two cats were playing football overtop of my head. So anyways I felt very sort of, weird, and wrote the following poem.\n \nbpNichol\n00:27:25\nPerforms unnamed poem.\n \nbpNichol\n00:29:06\nHugo Ball [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q70989] was kind of the daddy of us all, and he was kind of a very fine dadaist who lived in Switzerland [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q39] during the first World War [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q361] and sort of did the first sound poems. It was very strange, if you read Hugo Ball's diaries, it's rather fascinating because it was more or less, when he gave these sort of his final public reading he got really carried away in the midst of a sound poem an kind of got thrown back into sort of a--how to put this--an earlier space in his mind, anyways he went back and started remembering all sorts of things right back through his life doing this sound poem. As you read the diaries, there's a real feeling he became totally terrified of what was happening to him. Because at that point he then just split and left the whole thing behind. So this is kind of for Hugo Ball. It's called \"Dada Lama\". This poem's gone through so many changes I can't even keep track of it anymore.\n \nbpNichol\n00:30:28\nReads [sections of Dada Lama: a sound sequence in six parts, collected later in Selected Writing: As Elected]. \n \nLionel Kearns\n00:33:38\nI'm going to read some poems now from my collection, Pointing, which I see is for sale out on the other room. These poems are, for the most part, quiet poems, poems of my own measured voice. They're poems that originated a few years ago and they came out of the general West Coast poetry scene that was going on very intensely--hello?\n\nGeorge Bowering\n00:34:09\nIt\u2019s hard to hear... \n\nLionel Kearns\n00:34:10\nIs it hard to hear back there with this? \n\nUnknown\n00:34:12\nAmbient Sound [voices and laughter].\n\nLionel Kearns\n00:34:20\nI'll try--If I talk louder into the mic can you hear that? Keep letting me know, if you can't hear, shout. I'd like to read this one into the mic because they aren't poems that can be shouted. This one is called \"Situation\" and it derives from an experience I had in Mexico [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q96] many years ago. \n \nLionel Kearns\n00:35:06\nReads poem \"Situation\u201d [from Pointing].\n \nLionel Kearns\n00:36:24\nHow's that for sound, can you hear that? \"Insights\".\n\nLionel Kearns\n00:36:36\nReads \"Insights\" [from By the Light of the Silvery McLune: Media Parables, Poems, Signs, Gestures and other Assaults of the Interface]\/\n \nLionel Kearns\n00:36:55\nI'm very sentimental [audience laughter.] This is an early poem I wrote, it's called \"Homage to Machado\". It's really a translation of a poem by Antonio Machado [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q243771], the Spanish poet. I've not only translated it, I've switched the central image, but used his statement. His image was that of a boat going across a lake and he looked out and saw the ripple of the water behind it and  then commented on that. But I changed the metaphor.\n \nLionel Kearns\n00:37:45\nReads \"Hommage to Machado\" [from Pointing].\n \nLionel Kearns\n00:38:17\nReads \"Remains\" [from Pointing].\n \nLionel Kearns\n00:39:08\nReads \"Total Presence\" [from Pointing].\n \nLionel Kearns\n00:40:05\nA very small poem called \"Witness\".\n \nLionel Kearns\n00:40:07\nReads \"Witness\" [from Pointing].\n \nLionel Kearns\n00:40:38\nAnd this one, called \"Profile\". I'll read it without the mic.\n \nLionel Kearns\n00:40:45\nReads \"Profile\" [from Pointing].\n \nUnknown Audience Member 1\n00:41:32\nHave you ever thought of pausing it and--\n\nUnknown\n00:41:34\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n \nLionel Kearns\n00:41:37\nWe thought of reading all of our quiet poems at the beginning, and then getting louder and louder and louder, but we thought this would get you too excited and you'd go out onto the street and...[audience laughter.] So we decided to mix them all up and you'll get everything quiet and loud and funny and very serious and that's part of it,you know,getting them all at once all in juxtaposed relationships.\n \nbpNichol\n00:42:12\nThis way you can sort of do what you want with which ones you wanna do. It's very hard to listen to a poetry reading all the way through. I can never hack poetry readings myself [audience laughter]. What Lionel and I are trying to do is maybe do you a favour so you can listen for a longer time maybe [audience laughter].\n \nLionel Kearns\n00:42:32\nWho locked the door? [Audience laughter].\n \nbpNichol\n00:42:37\nAmong my poems from the last year which I lost, was a very long thing called The Martyrology which included all these things about a whole series of saints I'd evolved. Which had included St. Reet and St. Ranglehold and St. And and it's kind of too complicated to go into what they all sort of were doing, but St. Ranglehold came from the word 'stranglehold' and the rest you can kind of figure out maybe.\n \nbpNichol\n00:43:05\nReads unnamed poem from The Martyrology series.\n \nLionel Kearns\n00:43:56\nWas that loud enough by the way?\n \nbpNichol\n00:43:58\nCould you hear that? It's hard to tell from behind here. This is a poem called \"Ruth\" and it was for a good friend of mine, David W. Harris, who now calls himself David W.

Some concrete poetry is purely visual and you can't read it, it's to go on walls and things like that. Other concrete poetry is so sonic that it's nothing really to look at, but occasionally you can get the two combined so that you have something on the page which also is something else when read, but the two correspond. This one that I've got is to some extent like that, on the page it's called \"Studies in Interior Decoration Border Design\" because of the way it looks on the page, which of course being an audience at a poetry reading, you aren't concerned with. But I'll read it  and it does work, I think, sonically too. It's called \"The Woman Who Reminded Him of the Woman Who\".\n \nLionel Kearns\n00:51:20\nReads \"The Woman Who Reminded Him of the Woman Who\" [published as \u201cThe Woman Who\u201d in By the Light of the Silvery McLune: Media Parables, Poems, Signs, Gestures and other Assaults of the Interface].\n \nUnknown\n00:53:14\n[Cut or edit made in tape.

The original one was a Western made in Japan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q17], and Hollywood stole the idea and made a Western in the West. Now I've taken the same situation, the same story and given it a Northern locale. And that's why it's called \"The Seventh Seal\" [Audience laughter].

And it's--I've interpreted the dream. Some extent of the poem--I interpreted as a kind of message about where I get my images for my poems, or where I got them at this particular period. And I called \"Ambergris, a Statement on Source\". Ambergris, being that stuff that sick whales cough up and which floats around on the ocean and it's very smelly stuff but it's very valuable stuff if you find it floating around because you can sell it for a great deal of money to perfume factories.

It goes like this: \"A bibliography, in so far as my memory will produce it. Objectivist Issue of Poetry, Chicago [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1297], circa 1932.

Pound's Active Anthology, 1936, a number of little magazines during 33, 34, Hound and Horn, I believe, Lion and Crown, etc. There it is, you'll see, 25 year gap.

A forthcoming book, Of Being Numerous, New Directions [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q27474] scheduled for the spring of 1968.\" And he ends by saying, \"If there is a moral it is one has in fact a great deal of triumph, and then, recently, he has had the following books done: This in Which, by New Directions, 1957, The Materials, New Directions again, 1962, Of Being Numerous, 1968. Now if there's any a book of poems, Discrete Series, there is a long preface by Ezra Pound [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q163366], I'd like to quote a segment of that, which goes like this: \"I salute a serious craftsman, a sensibility which is not every man's sensibility, and which is not been got out of other man's books.\" Ladies and gentlemen, George Oppen.\n\nUnknown \n00:02:47\n[Cut or edit made in tape.

We can easily make a conversation if you want afterwards, but I think I better just read the books, read the poems, and I'll make a few intermissions, it's a great deal of poetry both for you and for me, at a single sitting, and we'll make intermissions as however you think, however I think. I'll start with the poem in Of Being Numerous, called \"The Route\". That's r-o-u-t-e, route.\n \nGeorge Oppen\n00:03:37\nReads \"The Route\" from Of Being Numerous.\n \nUnknown\n00:18:45\nSilence [cut or edit made in tape].\n \nGeorge Oppen\n00:18:58\nResumes reading \u201cThe Route\u2019\n \nUnknown\n00:22:14\n[Cut or edit made in tape].\n \nEND\n00:40:12\n"

Spending much of his childhood in San Francisco, Oppen enrolled in the Agricultural College at Corvallis (now University of Oregon) in 1926. He met his future wife, Mary Colby there, and they married in 1928. Oppen attended a prep school in Oakland in the hopes of enrolling at the University at Berkeley, but instead the couple made their way to New York in the hopes of meeting Ezra Pound.  In New York City, they met Charles Reznikoff and Louis Zukofsky, and in 1931 they formed the Objectivist movement. Having finally met Ezra Pound, Oppen\u2019s poetry was published in his Active Anthology in 1933 (Faber and Faber). Oppen\u2019s first collection of poetry, written in 1929, Discrete Series, was published by the Objectivist Press in 1934 and opened with a preface by Ezra Pound. From that point onwards, Oppen stopped writing poetry. The Depression had hit and the Oppens spent their time in the 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s organizing the unemployed in Brooklyn. Oppen served for the U.S. Army from 1943-1945 and received a Purple Heart among other honours. After the war, his family moved to Los Angeles, until 1950 when they were harassed by the McCarthy House Un-American Activities Committee for their affiliations with Communism. They fled to Mexico and resided there for eight years. By the time the Oppen family moved back to New York in 1958, Oppen had taken up poetry again. In 1962, Oppen published his second collection of poems, The Materials (New Directions Press), followed in 1965 with This In Which and Of Being Numerous in 1968 (New Directions Press), which won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1969. Seascape: Needle\u2019s Eye was published in 1972 (Sumac Press), and in 1975 Oppen compiled his previously published material with new poems in Collected Poems (New Directions). His final collection of poetry, Primitive was published in 1978 (Black Sparrow Press). George Oppen died in July 1984.\n"

It goes like this: \"A bibliography, in so far as my memory will produce it. Objectivist Issue of Poetry, Chicago [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1297], circa 1932.

Now if there's any a book of poems, Discrete Series, there is a long preface by Ezra Pound [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q163366], I'd like to quote a segment of that, which goes like this: \"I salute a serious craftsman, a sensibility which is not every man's sensibility, and which is not been got out of other man's books.\" Ladies and gentlemen, George Oppen.\n\nUnknown \n00:02:47\n[Cut or edit made in tape.

She has published essays, biography, she's working on a biography now, she has published a novel called The Orgy, she has published translations of the Mexican writer Octavio Paz [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q46739], and the Swedish poet Gunnar Ekel\u00f6f [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q366311], she has published a number of children's books and what else can I say? She's a New Yorker, she was born in New York [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60], she lives in New York, and so forth. I now introduce Muriel Rukeyser [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q735177].\n\nAudience\n00:00:40\nApplause. \n\nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:00:49\nThank you. It sounds peculiar when it's said that way, you know. It just means that I've been writing poems all along, and that sometimes there's been some prose or something film, prose, whatever it is, that spills into the poems that feeds into the poems. And they lie all the time about the poems to us, you know, about all of our poems they say it's something very odd and rare, that people who do it are very odd, if a man does it, he's sexually questionable, if a woman does it she's sexually questionable, besides, very few people do it [audience laughter]. And it's all lies, you know. There's a company in the United States [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30] that's made a fortune, on the premise that everybody takes a snapshot at some time or other, and I would like to ask you, and this is apart from all critical standards, all criteria, all faculty and institutions, apart from any of that. I would like to ask a question, how many of you here has ever written a poem, would you put up your hands please? [Audience laughter]. Thank you. I'm always nervous before I ask the question, I ask the question now in all rooms, no matter how few or many people there are and if the universities would generally look around to see if the basketball team is there, but there's always the moment of silence, and looking around first, and generally, quite slowly, almost all the hands go up, maybe four or five do not put up their hands and if I wait around afterwards, and with any luck and favorable wins, the four or five people come up to me and will say something like, I was 15, it was a love poem, it stank. [Audience laughter]. But the thing is it's a human activity. We all do it. We lie about it, you know, and they lie about it to us. And thanks now to the young, the poets maybe, a few other people one could name together, maybe we don't lie so much as we used to, maybe we don't lie about this anymore. Maybe we don't lie about sex, maybe we don't lie about poetry, they seem to lie a great deal about politics instead, it seems to shift around. There are these, and the fact is, we all write poems, it is something we do, we come to this part of experience, as you get a very rainy, rainy evening, why do people come and listen to poems? Or you've got some marvelous summer night, why do people come and listen to poems? Alright, it's partly out of curiosity and looking at the person and I go to see what is that breathing behind, what is that heartbeat, the breathing goes against the heartbeat and these rhythms are set up, and the involuntary muscles and you see the person do it but beyond that, something is what we call shared, something is arrived at, we come to something with almost unmediated, that is the poem among us, between us, there, we're reaching each other, you giving me whatever silence you are giving me and it comes to me with great strength, your silence. Somebody said prima donna, you know, or I'm going to give this to the audience and the conductor says that's what you think, you're going to get it from the audience. That's where it comes from in a funny way. So this mediation, it is not a description, it is not only the music and it, although certainly the reinforcement of sound. The sound climbing up and finally reaching a place, the last word, the sound that begins with the first breathing, the breath of the title. Keats [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q82083] doing Ode to a Nightingale [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3349126], we hardly ever say ode, nobody says nightingale, but Keats having said that, never has to say it again, it's a bird. You find it in these things, but from the beginning, from the first moment, that is the first breath, the thing that is made as, suggestion, breath, what my life has been, whatever that--what your lives have been. This is a very short one called \"Song\".\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:06:50\nReads \"Song\" [from Waterlily Fire and collected later in Collected Poems].\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:07:36\nThis is another very short one, I wanted to start with these and see what happened. I called it \"In Our Time\", it's very--it's four lines.\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:07:50\nReads \"In Our Time\" [from The Speed of Darkness].\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:08:12\nThis is called \"The Poem As Mask\". It's for another poem, a big Orpheus [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q174353] poem that I wrote a long time ago and it had the acting out the women on the mountain after the murder, the pieces of the man scattered about the top of the mountain. The slow coming together of the pieces as God. And I realized, long after, when I came to this newest book, Speed of Darkness, that this was a mask that I did not want anymore of this. You know how it is--it happens to undergraduates, say, it happens to the thing that was just before, and you see these girls acting very childish, and trading on it, and thinking they're still thirteen and able to influence their father, and it's been used up, used up, it served its purpose back there, but it isn't that anymore. And these, phases of being, \"The Poem As Mask\" for Orpheus.\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:09:25\nReads \"The Poem As Mask\" [from The Speed of Darkness].\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:10:42\nReads \"Air\" [from The Speed of Darkness].\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:11:43\nReads \"Poem\" [from The Speed of Darkness].\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:13:57\nReads \"Anemone\" [from The Speed of Darkness].\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:14:46\nReads \"For My Son\" [from The Speed of Darkness].\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:17:15\nReads \"Orgy\" [from The Speed of Darkness].\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:19:14\nThis is called \"Bunk Johnson Blowing\", if you know the early jazz men, the New Orleans [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q34404] jazz men, you'll know Bunk Johnson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q487021] and his trumpet. This is years later in San Francisco [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q62]. \"Bunk Johnson Blowing\" and the dedication is in memory of Lead Belly [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q314310], and his house on 59th Street, that's New York.\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:19:45\nReads \"Bunk Johnson Blowing\" [from The Speed of Darkness].\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:21:19\nReads \"Endless\" [from The Speed of Darkness].\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:22:53\nThis last one of the first group is called \"Clues\", it's a Canadian, British Columbia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1974] poem, is--how it is among the Thompson River [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2143805] Indians, or how it was in the anthropological moment, that flash of moment before it was broken up by this civilization, and we have caught up to some of this, without know what the hell it was, what this is. We are full of body painting, tattooing, emblems painted on ourselves, this is further. \"Clues\".\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:23:56\nReads \"Clues\" [from The Speed of Darkness].\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:25:55\nHere's one piece of a long poem, it's the last of a group called \"Elegies\", which one hardly dares name anything anymore. It's called \"Elegy in Joy\" and this is just a beginning piece, I wanted to do it tonight this way, I've never cut it up.\n \n Muriel Rukeyser\n00:26:17\nReads \"Elegy in Joy\" [from Elegies and collected later in Collected Poems].\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:28:26\nI thought of that very much at the beginning of this month in Mexico [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q96], and yesterday when I heard a story. It's a story of what happened at Christmas time, I was in Mexico, I wonder whether you saw it, I heard of it yesterday in New York, as a little, three line story, in the back page of the New York Times [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q9684], saying that the largest underground bomb test was about to be held in Nevada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1227] in the States, and to that test, the day before, came five scientists, in Utah [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q829], in the States, to protest, to picket, to try to stop it. And another person who protested, was Howard Hughes [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q189081], who owns most of Las Vegas [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q23768] at this point, and had his own reasons for protesting. These protests did not stop the testing. The test was made. It was the largest underground made yet. Do you know this story? There was a crack, a crack in the earth, big enough, they said, the way we talk, big enough that the Empire State Building [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q9188]. There's a crack there, and deep under the crust there's a three foot crack of some kind, and the rocks are still falling, and they say there will be earthquakes in various parts, unpredictable parts of the world as a result of the shift of the under-crust. Now, last night, before I came here, on TV, late news in New York, they said that there'd been a quake in the Fiji Islands [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q24570183]. I have no idea what the relations between these things are, I give it to you simply, that something has happened to shift the under-crust there will be unpredictable results. This is under the ground, the way we are bound to each other, we are all so bound to each other through the air and the fall out has come over Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16], this is also a part of the story that I heard yesterday, and you, I can see by your nods, you know this part of the story. People were saying one thing, and then the other about why don't we do this, why don't they do that, part of the story is that maybe nothing will fall because the Russians also wish to make underground tests. It's part of the ways in which we are bound to each other. I'll give you that. In Mexico, we are bound, under the ground, over the ground, in every way there is. In Mexico, though the stories of what really happened to the students in October, and the stories of people--of many students were killed and the police were among the crowd, and the police wore one white glove or tied a handkerchief around their right hand, and when the helicopters came over, these white hands were put up that said \"don't shoot us, we're police\". Many students were shot and they say in Mexico City [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1489] that the bodies were incinerated and no reports were made and no count was made, and these are the ways in which we are bound too. And yes, I have been translating Octavio Paz, and Ekelof is another such poet, but Paz, the end of one of Octavio's poems, was printed on this issue of the University Students' Journal of the University of Mexico, with the account of September, October, November, December. And the poem ends like this in English, it's not as good, I warn you, these translations are a folly on a madness on a stupidity and at the same time one has to do it, as work to which one is driven, out of love and gratitude, and also out a motive not so noble as any of that, during the times in which one cannot write poems, it is wonderful to have something one cares about out in front of one, and work with it that way, and it's the thing, not spinning out of oneself, in those times, but having something out in front. This is the end of the, of a great poem of Octavio Paz's called \"A Broken Jar\", and jar, of course, water jar, is something quite different in Mexico, we say 'jar', 'jug', something like that, it isn't in the thing we use every day, in Mexico, it's every day, it's that kind of broken jar.\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:33:33\nReads translation of \"A Broken Jar\" by Octavio Paz in English.\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:34:35\nThese are some poems, since my last book, and I don't know whether they are finished, they may be finished. The next book that these will be in will be called Breaking Open. This is a short one called \"Martin Luther King\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q8027].\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:34:56\nReads \"Martin Luther King\" [published later as \u201cMartin Luther King, Malcolm X\u201d in Breaking Open and collected in Collected Poems].\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:35:45\nThis is a poem, I found a long time ago, you probably have found it in the same way, it's on the back of a one of the Gauguin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q37693] watercolours, it's a piece of poem without any heading, without any signature, I didn't know what it was, and it stopped me, and it stayed in me, and I tried to turn it into English, and I couldn't do it. And I finally found out what it was and I finally turned it into English, it's a poem by Charles Morice [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2959857], who is hardly read, now, you know him? No, he's one of those people around Gauguin, and I said well, you can't print anything like that, people, and then 2001 [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q835341] was written and released, and 2001 has stargate, starbaby, the whole thing, and I put the name \"Next\" on this and I'm reading it to you partly for itself, but partly because one line of it is something I used in a poem I wrote when the same thing happened to many of us, the Olympics [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5389] committee wrote to us and asked for poems, you know, for the games, or for the times of the games, or for something. And one wasn't exactly going to do that, but there was something that could be said, and so on. Anyway, this is the Morice, and I've called it \"Next\".\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:37:25\nReads \"Next\", an English translation of an unnamed poem by Charles Morice [published later in Breaking Open and collected in Collected Poems].\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:38:19\nAnd this poem, using one line of that was what I sent to Mexico, it's called \"Voices\".\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:38:30\nReads \"Voices\" [published later in Breaking Open and collected in Collected Poems].\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:40:00\nThe last poem I'll read this evening is a group, the group is called \"The Speed of Darkness\". They're short poems, and I'll just pause between poems, there should be numbers going up in back of me, 1, 2, 3 [audience laughter]. I'll just pause. \"The Speed of Darkness\".\n\nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:40:27\nReads \"The Speed of Darkness\" from The Speed of Darkness. \n\nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:46:11\nThank you very much.\n \nAudience\n00:46:14\nApplause.\n \nIntroducer\n00:46:37\nWe wish to announce that the next reading will be by F.R. Scott [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3081656], and that will be on February 14, at the same time, in the theatre in the basement of this building. Thank you.\n \nUnknown\n00:46:58\nAmbient Sound [voices].\n \nEND\n00:51:24\n"

                "notes": "New York poet and activist Muriel Rukeyser was born in New York City in 1913. She attended Vassar College from 1930 to 1932, working on college newspapers and magazines. She co-founded the Student Review, edited the literary journal Housaton and attended summer courses at Columbia University. Her first book of poems, Theory of Flight (Yale University Press), published in 1935, was influenced from her brief experience at the Roosevelt Aviation School. U.S. 1 (Covici, Friede) was published three years later in 1938, and she was sent by the literary journal Life and Letters Today to report on the athletic competition staged by workers\u2019 sports clubs in Spain. Rukeyser subsequently published A Turning Wind (Viking Press) in 1939, Wake Island (Doubleday) in 1942, Beast in View (Doubleday) in 1944, The Green Wave (Doubleday) in 1948 and The poem as a mask: Orpheus (Unicorn Press) in 1949 (a long poem with drawings by Pablo Picasso). She received the Oscar Blumenthal Prize for Poetry in 1940, the Harriet Monroe Poetry Award in 1941, a grant from the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1942 and a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1943. She served as associate editor of Decision, a literary magazine edited by Klaus Mann. Muriel Rukeyser taught at Sarah Lawrence College in 1946, and the following year, she won the Levinson Prize for poetry. She published Body of Waking (Harper) in 1958, Waterlily Fire (Macmillan) in 1962, The speed of darkness (Random House) in 1968, Breaking Open (Random House) in 1973, The Gates (McGraw-Hill) in 1976 and finally Collected Poems (McGraw-Hill) in 1979. She translated the work of Mexican poet Octavio Paz and Swedish poet Gunnar Ekelof. Active in the protection of human rights, she was jailed in Washington, D.C, because of her protests of the Vietnam war. Between 1975 and 1976 she was president of PEN\u2019s American Center, traveling to South Korea in defense of poet Kim Chi-Ha. She was awarded an honorary doctorate from Rutgers University in 1961, a fellowship from the American Council of Learned Societies in 1963, the Shelley Memorial Award and the Copernicus Award for lifetime contribution to poetry in 1977. Muriel Rukeyser died in February 1980."

She's a New Yorker, she was born in New York [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60], she lives in New York, and so forth. I now introduce Muriel Rukeyser [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q735177].\n\nAudience\n00:00:40\nApplause. \n\nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:00:49\nThank you. It sounds peculiar when it's said that way, you know. It just means that I've been writing poems all along, and that sometimes there's been some prose or something film, prose, whatever it is, that spills into the poems that feeds into the poems. And they lie all the time about the poems to us, you know, about all of our poems they say it's something very odd and rare, that people who do it are very odd, if a man does it, he's sexually questionable, if a woman does it she's sexually questionable, besides, very few people do it [audience laughter]. And it's all lies, you know. There's a company in the United States [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30] that's made a fortune, on the premise that everybody takes a snapshot at some time or other, and I would like to ask you, and this is apart from all critical standards, all criteria, all faculty and institutions, apart from any of that. I would like to ask a question, how many of you here has ever written a poem, would you put up your hands please? [Audience laughter]. Thank you. I'm always nervous before I ask the question, I ask the question now in all rooms, no matter how few or many people there are and if the universities would generally look around to see if the basketball team is there, but there's always the moment of silence, and looking around first, and generally, quite slowly, almost all the hands go up, maybe four or five do not put up their hands and if I wait around afterwards, and with any luck and favorable wins, the four or five people come up to me and will say something like, I was 15, it was a love poem, it stank. [Audience laughter]. But the thing is it's a human activity. We all do it. We lie about it, you know, and they lie about it to us. And thanks now to the young, the poets maybe, a few other people one could name together, maybe we don't lie so much as we used to, maybe we don't lie about this anymore. Maybe we don't lie about sex, maybe we don't lie about poetry, they seem to lie a great deal about politics instead, it seems to shift around. There are these, and the fact is, we all write poems, it is something we do, we come to this part of experience, as you get a very rainy, rainy evening, why do people come and listen to poems? Or you've got some marvelous summer night, why do people come and listen to poems? Alright, it's partly out of curiosity and looking at the person and I go to see what is that breathing behind, what is that heartbeat, the breathing goes against the heartbeat and these rhythms are set up, and the involuntary muscles and you see the person do it but beyond that, something is what we call shared, something is arrived at, we come to something with almost unmediated, that is the poem among us, between us, there, we're reaching each other, you giving me whatever silence you are giving me and it comes to me with great strength, your silence. Somebody said prima donna, you know, or I'm going to give this to the audience and the conductor says that's what you think, you're going to get it from the audience. That's where it comes from in a funny way. So this mediation, it is not a description, it is not only the music and it, although certainly the reinforcement of sound. The sound climbing up and finally reaching a place, the last word, the sound that begins with the first breathing, the breath of the title. Keats [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q82083] doing Ode to a Nightingale [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3349126], we hardly ever say ode, nobody says nightingale, but Keats having said that, never has to say it again, it's a bird. You find it in these things, but from the beginning, from the first moment, that is the first breath, the thing that is made as, suggestion, breath, what my life has been, whatever that--what your lives have been. This is a very short one called \"Song\".\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:06:50\nReads \"Song\" [from Waterlily Fire and collected later in Collected Poems].\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:07:36\nThis is another very short one, I wanted to start with these and see what happened. I called it \"In Our Time\", it's very--it's four lines.\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:07:50\nReads \"In Our Time\" [from The Speed of Darkness].\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:08:12\nThis is called \"The Poem As Mask\". It's for another poem, a big Orpheus [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q174353] poem that I wrote a long time ago and it had the acting out the women on the mountain after the murder, the pieces of the man scattered about the top of the mountain. The slow coming together of the pieces as God. And I realized, long after, when I came to this newest book, Speed of Darkness, that this was a mask that I did not want anymore of this. You know how it is--it happens to undergraduates, say, it happens to the thing that was just before, and you see these girls acting very childish, and trading on it, and thinking they're still thirteen and able to influence their father, and it's been used up, used up, it served its purpose back there, but it isn't that anymore. And these, phases of being, \"The Poem As Mask\" for Orpheus.\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:09:25\nReads \"The Poem As Mask\" [from The Speed of Darkness].\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:10:42\nReads \"Air\" [from The Speed of Darkness].\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:11:43\nReads \"Poem\" [from The Speed of Darkness].\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:13:57\nReads \"Anemone\" [from The Speed of Darkness].\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:14:46\nReads \"For My Son\" [from The Speed of Darkness].\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:17:15\nReads \"Orgy\" [from The Speed of Darkness].\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:19:14\nThis is called \"Bunk Johnson Blowing\", if you know the early jazz men, the New Orleans [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q34404] jazz men, you'll know Bunk Johnson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q487021] and his trumpet. This is years later in San Francisco [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q62]. \"Bunk Johnson Blowing\" and the dedication is in memory of Lead Belly [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q314310], and his house on 59th Street, that's New York.\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:19:45\nReads \"Bunk Johnson Blowing\" [from The Speed of Darkness].\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:21:19\nReads \"Endless\" [from The Speed of Darkness].\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:22:53\nThis last one of the first group is called \"Clues\", it's a Canadian, British Columbia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1974] poem, is--how it is among the Thompson River [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2143805] Indians, or how it was in the anthropological moment, that flash of moment before it was broken up by this civilization, and we have caught up to some of this, without know what the hell it was, what this is. We are full of body painting, tattooing, emblems painted on ourselves, this is further. \"Clues\".\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:23:56\nReads \"Clues\" [from The Speed of Darkness].\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:25:55\nHere's one piece of a long poem, it's the last of a group called \"Elegies\", which one hardly dares name anything anymore. It's called \"Elegy in Joy\" and this is just a beginning piece, I wanted to do it tonight this way, I've never cut it up.\n \n Muriel Rukeyser\n00:26:17\nReads \"Elegy in Joy\" [from Elegies and collected later in Collected Poems].\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:28:26\nI thought of that very much at the beginning of this month in Mexico [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q96], and yesterday when I heard a story. It's a story of what happened at Christmas time, I was in Mexico, I wonder whether you saw it, I heard of it yesterday in New York, as a little, three line story, in the back page of the New York Times [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q9684], saying that the largest underground bomb test was about to be held in Nevada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1227] in the States, and to that test, the day before, came five scientists, in Utah [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q829], in the States, to protest, to picket, to try to stop it. And another person who protested, was Howard Hughes [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q189081], who owns most of Las Vegas [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q23768] at this point, and had his own reasons for protesting. These protests did not stop the testing. The test was made. It was the largest underground made yet. Do you know this story? There was a crack, a crack in the earth, big enough, they said, the way we talk, big enough that the Empire State Building [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q9188]. There's a crack there, and deep under the crust there's a three foot crack of some kind, and the rocks are still falling, and they say there will be earthquakes in various parts, unpredictable parts of the world as a result of the shift of the under-crust. Now, last night, before I came here, on TV, late news in New York, they said that there'd been a quake in the Fiji Islands [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q24570183]. I have no idea what the relations between these things are, I give it to you simply, that something has happened to shift the under-crust there will be unpredictable results. This is under the ground, the way we are bound to each other, we are all so bound to each other through the air and the fall out has come over Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16], this is also a part of the story that I heard yesterday, and you, I can see by your nods, you know this part of the story. People were saying one thing, and then the other about why don't we do this, why don't they do that, part of the story is that maybe nothing will fall because the Russians also wish to make underground tests. It's part of the ways in which we are bound to each other. I'll give you that. In Mexico, we are bound, under the ground, over the ground, in every way there is. In Mexico, though the stories of what really happened to the students in October, and the stories of people--of many students were killed and the police were among the crowd, and the police wore one white glove or tied a handkerchief around their right hand, and when the helicopters came over, these white hands were put up that said \"don't shoot us, we're police\". Many students were shot and they say in Mexico City [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1489] that the bodies were incinerated and no reports were made and no count was made, and these are the ways in which we are bound too. And yes, I have been translating Octavio Paz, and Ekelof is another such poet, but Paz, the end of one of Octavio's poems, was printed on this issue of the University Students' Journal of the University of Mexico, with the account of September, October, November, December. And the poem ends like this in English, it's not as good, I warn you, these translations are a folly on a madness on a stupidity and at the same time one has to do it, as work to which one is driven, out of love and gratitude, and also out a motive not so noble as any of that, during the times in which one cannot write poems, it is wonderful to have something one cares about out in front of one, and work with it that way, and it's the thing, not spinning out of oneself, in those times, but having something out in front. This is the end of the, of a great poem of Octavio Paz's called \"A Broken Jar\", and jar, of course, water jar, is something quite different in Mexico, we say 'jar', 'jug', something like that, it isn't in the thing we use every day, in Mexico, it's every day, it's that kind of broken jar.\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:33:33\nReads translation of \"A Broken Jar\" by Octavio Paz in English.\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:34:35\nThese are some poems, since my last book, and I don't know whether they are finished, they may be finished. The next book that these will be in will be called Breaking Open. This is a short one called \"Martin Luther King\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q8027].\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:34:56\nReads \"Martin Luther King\" [published later as \u201cMartin Luther King, Malcolm X\u201d in Breaking Open and collected in Collected Poems].\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:35:45\nThis is a poem, I found a long time ago, you probably have found it in the same way, it's on the back of a one of the Gauguin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q37693] watercolours, it's a piece of poem without any heading, without any signature, I didn't know what it was, and it stopped me, and it stayed in me, and I tried to turn it into English, and I couldn't do it. And I finally found out what it was and I finally turned it into English, it's a poem by Charles Morice [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2959857], who is hardly read, now, you know him? No, he's one of those people around Gauguin, and I said well, you can't print anything like that, people, and then 2001 [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q835341] was written and released, and 2001 has stargate, starbaby, the whole thing, and I put the name \"Next\" on this and I'm reading it to you partly for itself, but partly because one line of it is something I used in a poem I wrote when the same thing happened to many of us, the Olympics [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5389] committee wrote to us and asked for poems, you know, for the games, or for the times of the games, or for something. And one wasn't exactly going to do that, but there was something that could be said, and so on. Anyway, this is the Morice, and I've called it \"Next\".\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:37:25\nReads \"Next\", an English translation of an unnamed poem by Charles Morice [published later in Breaking Open and collected in Collected Poems].\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:38:19\nAnd this poem, using one line of that was what I sent to Mexico, it's called \"Voices\".\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:38:30\nReads \"Voices\" [published later in Breaking Open and collected in Collected Poems].\n \nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:40:00\nThe last poem I'll read this evening is a group, the group is called \"The Speed of Darkness\". They're short poems, and I'll just pause between poems, there should be numbers going up in back of me, 1, 2, 3 [audience laughter]. I'll just pause. \"The Speed of Darkness\".\n\nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:40:27\nReads \"The Speed of Darkness\" from The Speed of Darkness. \n\nMuriel Rukeyser\n00:46:11\nThank you very much.\n \nAudience\n00:46:14\nApplause.\n \nIntroducer\n00:46:37\nWe wish to announce that the next reading will be by F.R. Scott [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3081656], and that will be on February 14, at the same time, in the theatre in the basement of this building. Thank you.\n \nUnknown\n00:46:58\nAmbient Sound [voices].\n \nEND\n00:51:24\n",

            "contents": "fr_scott_i006-11-112-1.mp3 [File 1 of 2]\n\nF.R. Scott\n00:00:00\nLadies and gentleman, the poems I'm going to read stretch over a period, it seems hard to believe, of about 45 years, and the writing of poetry has changed quite as much in that time as the world has changed, and probably for the same reason. Some of the poems I start with, you are actually going to hear a rhyme, and they're going to be structured. And you won't appreciate it, but some are going to vary the rhyme form in a way which, when they were written, seemed really quite daring. And I have witnessed, and as poets go on, it will always happen, this continuous evolution of the method--the method of expression and the forms of expression, that the poet, like any other artist, uses. I'm going to start at the beginning of my writing, I was born in Quebec City [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2145], grew up there. The Laurentian mountains [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q75596] are ten miles away, my father was a great lover of nature, we went into the country for picnics all the time, he used to put me at the edge of the mountains and say \"Frank, look North, there's nothing between you and the North Pole\". And after I'd been three and a half years at Oxford [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q34433] and in Europe [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q46], soaking up nothing up but human history, the background and fundamentals of our civilization, I came back to Montreal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q340], which seemed an incredibly ugly, empty, valueless city. The one thing that matched the power of the European tradition was this North land. It's emptiness, it's waiting. So I remember poems touching upon that feeling, and I will read first, this poem is really 45 years old, \"New Names\".\n \nF.R. Scott\n00:02:31\nReads \"New Names\" [from F.R. Scott: Selected Poems].\n \nF.R. Scott\n00:03:26\nReads \"Old Song\" [from F.R. Scott: Selected Poems]..\n \nF.R. Scott\n00:04:17\n\"Trees In Ice\", we've all seen trees in ice.\n \nF.R.

Scott\n00:06:55\nReads \"Stone\" [from F.R. Scott: Selected Poems].\n \nF.R. Scott\n00:08:09\nAnd in the same vein, here is a street cry modeled on the street cries of London [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q84] when they were selling--women were selling on the streets--\"Street Cry\".\n \nF.R. Scott\n00:08:34\nReads \"Street Cry\".\n \nF.R. Scott\n00:09:03\nOne sees this north land, subject to man's invasion. This is called \"Laurentian Shield\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q76034], which as you know, the name of the geological formation that covers most of the northern part of this country.\n \nF.R. Scott\n00:09:41\nReads \"Laurentian Shield\" [from F.R. Scott: Selected Poems].\n \nF.R. Scott\n00:12:27\nAnd \"Flying to Fort Smith\". I went down the Mackenzie river [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3411] and flew from Edmonton [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2096] to Fort Smith [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q686415] over the Peace River [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2220] and these other rivers underneath which wind through the flat plain.\n \nF.R. Scott\n00:12:53\nReads \"Flying to Fort Smith\" [from F.R. Scott: Selected Poems].\n \nF.R. Scott\n00:14:14\nHere's a fairly recent poem to be published shortly. It's called \"T.V. Weatherman\" and it's dedicated to Percy Saltzman [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7167559].\n \nF.R. Scott\n00:14:41\nReads \"T.V. Weatherman\".\n \nF.R.

Scott: Selected Poems].\n \nF.R. Scott\n00:19:19\nHere's another recent poem, called \"On the Terrace, Quebec\". You imagine yourself on the terrace of Chateau Frontenac [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q745964] looking at the basin.\n \n \nF.R. Scott\n00:19:41\nReads \"On the Terrace, Quebec\".\n \nF.R. Scott\n00:21:28\n\"A Grain of Rice\", a poem I wrote in Burma [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q836], thinking of the Korean war [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q8663], seeing the monsoon rains, reflecting on man and the universe in which he lives. \"A Grain of Rice\".\n \nF.R. Scott\n00:22:04\nReads \"A Grain of Rice\" [from F.R. Scott: Selected Poems].\n \nF.R. Scott\n00:24:25\nReads \"The Bird\" [from F.R. Scott: Selected Poems].\n \nF.R. Scott\n00:26:40\nHere's another version of an old story. It's called \"Eden\".\n \nF.R. Scott\n00:26:57\nReads \"Eden\" [from F.R. Scott: Selected Poems].\n \nF.R. Scott\n00:29:25\nAnd now, one or two more found poems. The first is from the Canadian Indian Pavilion at Expo [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1344988]. And it is found in this way, and those of you that saw that pavilion remember that they had these various rooms and in each room they had one or two lines of statements, up on the wall, about themselves and their relations with the white man. And all I did was to collect these various statements from a number of rooms and put them together to make a single poem, and it goes like this, I call it \"The Indians Speak at Expo 67\".\n \nF.R. Scott\n00:30:24\nReads \"The Indians Speak at Expo 67\".\n \nF.R. Scott\n00:31:44\nIn one of those rooms, there was a treaty between the British Crown and some Indian Chiefs. These treaties all had one purpose: they were to transfer valuable lands to Indians to the white man. And the treaties I may say always succeeded. This treaty was written out in a very formal manuscript, and the Indians had got hold of the original parchment, or whatever it was on, and they had blown it up to a great big thing they had up on the wall. The treaty was signed by two chiefs, signed--that is to say--the chiefs could not sign their names and presumably could not read the treaty, but they made little drawings, marks, to indicate that they had approved, and this what part of the treaty contains. There was a signature at the top, Chief Ningaram and at the bottom, Chief Wobumingwam.\n \nF.R. Scott\n00:32:56\nReads unnamed poem.\n \nF.R. Scott\n00:34:07\nAnd about 30,000 acres of the richest land in Southern Ontario [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1904] went for a song to the chiefs who couldn't sign their names. And I just came across the other day, in a book that I picked up, another thing I think I could call a 'found poem', also by the Indians, it's in The Life of McGillivray, the great fur trader of Montreal and his North West Company [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1142049], you know in the early part of the last century, around 1810-20. This is an account of the North West Company, describing how they relate themselves to the Indians, and you will see the philanthropy.\n \nF.R. Scott\n00:34:54\nReads unnamed poem.\n \nEND\n00:35:32\n\n\nfr_scott_i006-11-112-2.mp3 [File 2 of 2]\n\nF.R. Scott\n00:00:00\nHere's a poem, some poems of sentiment, a poem called \"Will to Win\". It's full of the imagery, it came out of the resistance movement in France [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q142], during WW2 [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q362], the Marquis hiding, having supplies dropped to them etc., etc.\n \nF.R. Scott\n00:00:25\nReads \"Will to Win\" [from F.R. Scott: Selected Poems].\n \nF.R. Scott\n00:01:50\nReads unnamed poem.\n \nF.R. Scott\n00:02:48\nReads \"Girl Running Down Hill\" [from F.R.

Scott\n00:05:39\nHere's a translation from Jacques Boraux [sp?], it's in his recent book that won the Prix de France. The poem is called \"Connaissance, Knowing\".\n \nF.R. Scott\n00:06:00\nReads \"Connaissance, Knowing\u201d.\n \nF.R.

Scott\n00:15:23\nAnd finally, a poem called \"A l'ange avant-gardien\". It seems strange, but I was brought up to believe there was a guardian angel, un ange gardien, looking after me, so you felt a little more secure. As you know, there are certain places in this province called l'ange gardien. So I thought of the avant, l'ange avant-gardien. Stevens had a necessary angel, which to him was reality. Many people have angels, but this challenging avant-garde angel always asking you to be in the avant=garde, seems to me what I was thinking about. \"A l'ange avant-gardien\".\n \nF.R. Scott\n00:16:53\nReads \"A l'ange avant-gardien\".\n \nEND\n00:18:01\n"

Educated at Bishop\u2019s College, Lennoxville, and then at Oxford University where he received his B.A. in 1922, and his B.Litt in 1923 on a Rhodes scholarship. In 1926 he graduated from McGill University in Montreal with a Law degree. It was at McGill, after meeting A.J.M. Smith, that he became interested in the current poetry scene. With Smith and Leon Edel, Scott founded The McGill fortnightly review (1925-1927), which then became The Canadian Mercury (1928-1929). After practicing law for a year, he returned to teach at McGill in 1928. In 1936 he and Smith co-edited the first anthology of modern Canadian poetry, New Provinces: Poems of Several Authors (Macmillan, 1936), and he was subsequently involved in many influential literary journals and anthologies of Canadian poetry. Preview begun with the help of Scott, A.M. Klein and P.K. Page in 1942, and in 1945 it merged with First Statement to become the Northern Review (1945-1956). Scott also was an advising editor of The Tamarack Review in 1956. Scott\u2019s first collection of poems was Overture (Ryerson Press), published in 1945, delayed by the Depression, but was followed by Events and signals (Ryerson Press, 1954), The eye of the needle (Contact Press, 1957), Signature (Klanak Press and McGill University Press, 1964) and Selected poems (Oxford University Press, 1966). Scott became the dean of law at McGill in 1961 until 1964, retiring in 1968. Not only was Scott an important figure in Canadian poetry, he was heavily involved with politics, law and the translation of French literature. Scott was the President of the League for Social Reconstruction in 1935-7. He was the national chairman of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation from 1942 to 1950. Scott helped to found the New Party in the 60\u2018s, what is known as the New Democratic Party today. He also worked several high-priority civil rights cases, Switzman v. Elbing (1957) and Roncarelli v. Duplessis (1958) in front of the Supreme Court. F.R. Scott was awarded the Lorne Piece Medal for distinguished service to Canadian literature in 1962. He received the Canada Council Translation Prize for Poems of French Canada (Blackfish press, 1977), a Governor General\u2019s Award for Essays on the constitution: aspects of Canadian law and politics (University of Toronto Press, 1977) as well as a second Governor General\u2019s Award for The collected poems of F.R. Scott (McClelland and Stewart) in 1981. F.R. Scott died in 1985."

Scott\n00:00:00\nLadies and gentleman, the poems I'm going to read stretch over a period, it seems hard to believe, of about 45 years, and the writing of poetry has changed quite as much in that time as the world has changed, and probably for the same reason. Some of the poems I start with, you are actually going to hear a rhyme, and they're going to be structured. And you won't appreciate it, but some are going to vary the rhyme form in a way which, when they were written, seemed really quite daring. And I have witnessed, and as poets go on, it will always happen, this continuous evolution of the method--the method of expression and the forms of expression, that the poet, like any other artist, uses. I'm going to start at the beginning of my writing, I was born in Quebec City [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2145], grew up there. The Laurentian mountains [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q75596] are ten miles away, my father was a great lover of nature, we went into the country for picnics all the time, he used to put me at the edge of the mountains and say \"Frank, look North, there's nothing between you and the North Pole\". And after I'd been three and a half years at Oxford [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q34433] and in Europe [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q46], soaking up nothing up but human history, the background and fundamentals of our civilization, I came back to Montreal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q340], which seemed an incredibly ugly, empty, valueless city. The one thing that matched the power of the European tradition was this North land. It's emptiness, it's waiting. So I remember poems touching upon that feeling, and I will read first, this poem is really 45 years old, \"New Names\".\n \nF.R. Scott\n00:02:31\nReads \"New Names\" [from F.R.

Scott\n00:29:25\nAnd now, one or two more found poems. The first is from the Canadian Indian Pavilion at Expo [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1344988]. And it is found in this way, and those of you that saw that pavilion remember that they had these various rooms and in each room they had one or two lines of statements, up on the wall, about themselves and their relations with the white man. And all I did was to collect these various statements from a number of rooms and put them together to make a single poem, and it goes like this, I call it \"The Indians Speak at Expo 67\".\n \nF.R. Scott\n00:30:24\nReads \"The Indians Speak at Expo 67\".\n \nF.R. Scott\n00:31:44\nIn one of those rooms, there was a treaty between the British Crown and some Indian Chiefs. These treaties all had one purpose: they were to transfer valuable lands to Indians to the white man. And the treaties I may say always succeeded. This treaty was written out in a very formal manuscript, and the Indians had got hold of the original parchment, or whatever it was on, and they had blown it up to a great big thing they had up on the wall. The treaty was signed by two chiefs, signed--that is to say--the chiefs could not sign their names and presumably could not read the treaty, but they made little drawings, marks, to indicate that they had approved, and this what part of the treaty contains. There was a signature at the top, Chief Ningaram and at the bottom, Chief Wobumingwam.\n \nF.R. Scott\n00:32:56\nReads unnamed poem.\n \nF.R. Scott\n00:34:07\nAnd about 30,000 acres of the richest land in Southern Ontario [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1904] went for a song to the chiefs who couldn't sign their names. And I just came across the other day, in a book that I picked up, another thing I think I could call a 'found poem', also by the Indians, it's in The Life of McGillivray, the great fur trader of Montreal and his North West Company [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1142049], you know in the early part of the last century, around 1810-20. This is an account of the North West Company, describing how they relate themselves to the Indians, and you will see the philanthropy.\n \nF.R.

Jones reads from Phrases from Orpheus (Oxford University Press, 1967), as well as a few that were published later in Under the Thunder the Flowers Light up the Earth (Coach House Press, 1977) and an unnamed long poem that may have been published in Poetry 62 (Ryerson Press 1961).",
            "contents": "eli_mandel_i086-11-034.mp3 [File 1 of 2]\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:00:00\n...start with the poesy, I've been asked to announce that on Friday, i.e., what's this the seventh? Two weeks from tonight, March the 21st at 9 o\u2019clock. in Room 653, [Barnes (?)] willing, there will be a program, I guess within the auspices of the Fine Arts department, the Ira Cohen [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1097790], New York [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60] film maker, and poet will be showing three of his films, as far as I know for the first time in Montreal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q340]. That's two weeks tonight at 9 in 653. When I was asked to introduce Eli Mandel [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3050883], and D.G. Jones [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5203595], I said, 'that's ridiculous', Canadian poetry being the way it is, they already know each other. And after the moment of hilarity I was brought to my senses, and I began to think that it really did make a lot of sense that we do have Doug Jones and Eli Mandel reading on the same program. I can remember in 1961 when Poetry 62 came out, Canadian poetry being the way it is [audience laughter], Poetry 62 was edited by Jean-Guy Pilon [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3166089] I believe and Eli Mandel, being a bilingual book, and at the time the poem that struck me as the most interesting was the long poem by D.G. Jones, the most interesting in that anthology, and I therefore, felt kind of warm, without having them, to both of them to Doug's poem and Eli's great taste for putting it in the anthology. And then I thought that there was this kind of confluence going on and I began to see all kinds of other things happening too, for instance, they both had their first books published by Contact Press, that published the first books of most of the important Canadian poets, and they now have seen their careers sort of criss-cross one another in a kind of a funny way because they each have three books, except that Eli has three and a third, which is also kind of Canadian, and I thought it was kind of interesting because not only is there a kind of parallel going on, and they both in 1967, for instance, turned out very good books of poetry, but there's a kind of uh, they'll be kind of an interesting contrast I think in tonight's program because I've always considered that Doug Jones is sort of the best of the Ontario [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1904] Wasp poets [audience laughter], and Eli Mandel is the best of the Western Jewish poets and they both deal with essential problems that seem to expose their two opposing and therefore contrary and conjugal, you might almost say, attitudes towards the business of writing poems. So we're going to start off with Eli's reading, and then have something like a ten minute break, and then we'll have Doug Jones' reading. I should mention that of those two books, Eli's is called An Idiot Joy and it shared the Governor General's Award [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q283256] given in 1968, and published by Hurtig, Edmonton [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2096] publisher, who is very pleased to get the Governor General's Award, and Doug Jones' book is Phrases from Orpheus, published by Oxford Press [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q217595], two books that would be well worth investing both your heaven, forbid, money and your imagination upon. I'm probably not going to say anything before D.G. Jones comes to read, so I'm not expecting to come up here and spout for five or ten minutes before he reads and I'm not going to spout any longer before Eli reads. So I'd first like to introduce to you Mr. Eli Mandel.\n\nAudience\n00:05:01\nApplause. \n \nEli Mandel\n00:05:29\nI think George [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1239280] might have carried the parallel of contrasts and comparisons a little further had he wanted to, or chosen to, or had he known about certain very intimate details about Doug's life and my life. But I don't propose to go into those myself right now either [audience laughter]. Instead, I'm going to read, primarily from An Idiot Joy, but also from Black and Secret Man, which was an earlier book and also from one or two manuscript poems that I've been working on recently. I want to start with a poem called \"Signatures\" and although I can say a lot about a number of poems that I've written, I'm not sure I can say much about this except that as will be obvious to you I think, the imagery is drawn from the Vietnam [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q881] conflict, though I don't know that the poem is necessarily about that. Can you hear me with this mic? Some people at the back are saying 'no'. Can you hear me now?\n \nEli Mandel\n00:07:00\nReads \"Signatures\" [from An Idiot Joy].\n \nEli Mandel\n00:09:27\nThis poem is called \"Neither Here Nor There\".\n \nEli Mandel\n00:09:33\nReads \"Neither Here Nor There\" [published later in Crusoe: Poems Selected and New].\n \nEli Mandel\n00:10:28\nThis is a poem from Black and Secret Man and it's called \"The Direction is North Until the Pole\", and I suppose it's one of the few poems I've written that I would call a Canadian poem, that is to say it draws on a number of specific images from the Canadian landscape and therefore I have to annotate this poem. I have to tell you that the Fleming mentioned in the last line of the poem was once a Minister of Finance in the federal government, that just proves how transient political poems really are. I think all the rest of this should be clear, hockey is a game that's played in Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16].\n \nEli Mandel\n00:11:16\nReads \"The Direction is North Until the Pole\" from Black and Secret Man.\n \nEli Mandel\n00:13:24\nThis is one of my prophetic poems. I think I've written a lot of really prophetic poems. This poem is called \"Departure\" and it tells about leaving Edmonton. Everybody who has read the poem believes that I wrote it when I decided to leave Edmonton, either for the first time or the second time, I've left there twice, as a matter of fact, I didn't write it when I decided to leave in Edmonton, I wrote it when I arrived in Edmonton.\n \nEli Mandel\n00:13:53\nReads \"Departure\" [from Black and Secret Man].\n \nEli Mandel\n00:14:37\nA little poem about one of my perversions, this is about making love to pregnant women, I think, I'm not sure if there's a technical name for that but the perversion appears in the poem. The poem's called \"Cassandra\" and it's about a prophetess, Cassandra [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q170779], you'll remember was the woman that Agamemnon [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q128176]  brought home with him to his wife, Clytemnestra [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q131157], and this, so angered Clytemnestra, aside from the fact that Agamemnon had killed one of their daughters, that she killed Agamemnon, but Cassandra was a Prophetess, like Prophetesses, was given the power to tell the truth and was never believed. Some of the imagery in this poem is taken from the story of Cassandra, and the rest from my perversions.\n \nEli Mandel\n00:15:39\nReads \"Cassandra\" [from Black and Secret Man].\n \nEli Mandel\n00:17:00\nReads \"The Madness of our Polity\" [from An Idiot Joy].\n \nEli Mandel\n00:17:46\n\"Whence Cometh Our Help?\", the title is taken from the Psalms [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q41064], and there are a number of images of the Psalms, in the poem. Or images from the Psalms.\n \nEli Mandel\n00:18:04\nReads \"Whence Cometh Our Help?\" [from An Idiot Joy].\n \nEli Mandel\n00:19:03\nThis poem is called \"Manner of Suicide\", and it's the closest thing I've come to writing a found poem, in that all the material in the poem, the words are taken from two sources, except for the first line. One is Karl Menninger's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3080926] Man Against Himself and the other, the Jewish Daily Prayer Book. There are twenty-six ways listed here of committing suicide, they're all ways that Menninger lists and documents, and he lists them in the order in which I give them here, and this list, which I give, is then followed by some comments he makes about those ways of committing suicide and a passage from the prayer book.\n \nEli Mandel\n00:20:11\nReads \"Manner of Suicide\" [from An Idiot Joy].\n \nEli Mandel\n00:23:24\nIn An Idiot Joy I wrote a number of poems which were, which used two primary images, the image of the moon and the image of the sea, and these are love poems. I suppose the interesting thing in them to me, aside from the personal sense that I feel about them, is that with each of the poems, whether it's with the image of the moon or the image of the sea, or both, I keep trying different technical things in the poetry, and so far as I'm concerned, I've done some more interesting technical things in this than anywhere else, but primarily, the poems talk about the moon and the sea, and seabirds and women and a woman.\n \nEli Mandel\n00:24:30\nReads \"Woman in the Moon\" from An Idiot Joy.\n \nEli Mandel\n00:26:12\nReads \"The Explanations of the Moon\u201d [from An Idiot Joy].\n \nEli Mandel\n00:27:32\nThis is one of the sea poems, in the sequence, called \"Listen, the Sea\", and the title comes from King Lear [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q181598], though actually, I had become aware of it of course when I knew that Keats [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q82083] had written a sonnet using this, but the technique is neither Shakespearean nor Keatsean, nothing of the kind.\n \nEli Mandel\n00:28:00\nReads \"Listen, the Sea\" [from An Idiot Joy].\n \nEli Mandel\n00:29:01\nAnd \"Marina\", who is a daughter of the sea.\n \nEli Mandel\n00:29:09\nReads \"Marina\" [from An Idiot Joy].\n \nEli Mandel\n00:30:46\nWell something quite different. I think I should dedicate this to George Bowering, because I wrote the poem after I had been\u2026\n\nUnknown\n00:30:56\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n\nEli Mandel\n00:30:57\nAnd I would have to apologize for this, but the last thing in the world that I wanted to do was apologize, I'd prefer anything but that, I mean this is pretty simple-minded simplistic psychology, of the worst order I suppose, I just--I'm writing a poem about how stupid I felt at that particular moment.\n \nEli Mandel\n00:31:17\nReads \"The Apology\" [from An Idiot Joy].\n \nEli Mandel\n00:34:34\nThis is the poem I like to think of as the one that one would put in a time capsule, it's called \"Letter to be Opened Later\" and presumably each one of us wants to immortalize oneself, and imagine, you know, two thousand years later the time capsule being opened and then they can read your letter. This is my letter, to be opened later.\n \nEli Mandel\n00:35:12\nReads \"Letter to be Opened Later\" [published later in Crusoe: Poems Selected and New ].\n \nEli Mandel\n00:36:09\nI'm going to read a lyric, it's a very short poem, but I'd like to read this one anyhow. It's called \"To My Children\" and it's based upon both an odd and rather terrifying coincidence in my life and a curious Jewish tradition. The Jewish tradition is that you name a child after the nearest dead relative, the relative who has died most recently and who is closest to one, and it so happened that my mother died, my daughter was born, my father died and my son was born. And I wrote this poem about the naming of the children. It's called \"To My Children\".\n \nEli Mandel\n00:37:08\nReads \"To My Children\" [from Black and Secret Man].\n \nEli Mandel\n00:38:00\nNow I'm going to finish this reading with two poems, one is called \"The Meaning of the I Ching\" and the other \"Cosmos: the Giant Rose\"--three poems, I'm sorry. I'm going to read \"Pictures in an Institution\" as well. \"The Meaning of the I Ching\", the I Ching [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q181937] as you probably know is a book of divination, it's the oldest book of divination known, and when I first heard about it, I looked at the book before I opened it and I wondered about the very simple notion of a book that old telling my future. How could I be contained in this ancient book? And I wrote this poem. Now it seems to me that there is something remarkable here, it's one claim I will make for the poem, at least, in the poem, is the first time I used the phrase \"earth upon earth\" and the very first hexagram that I cast when I opened the book. The book tells fortunes with what are called hexagrams and hexagrams are given various names, the very first one that I cast was the hexagram \"earth upon earth\" and that's simply something that happened whether it means that the poem is prophetic or magical, I don't know.\n \nEli Mandel\n00:39:36\nReads \"The Meaning of the I Ching\" [from An Idiot Joy].\n \nEli Mandel\n00:43:18\nI'm going to finish now reading \"Pictures in an Institution\". This is the most personal poem I've ever written, and I don't want to read anything after that, so I'm going to finish with this. \"Pictures in an Institution\". I think all I need to say about this is that it plays off notices against some personal experiences and I think that'll be plain enough.\n \nEli Mandel\n00:43:43\nReads \"Pictures in an Institution\" [from Trio: First Poems by Gael Turnbull, Phyllis Webb, and Eli Mandel].\n\nEli Mandel\n00:47:40\nThank you.\n\nAudience\n00:47:41\nApplause.\n\nUnknown\n00:47:51\n[Cut or edit made in tape.

Jones\n00:48:60\nI'm going to do this because I'm thirsty. It's a little disturbing but I've had a suspicion that this was becoming true for some time, in the last few years, that pretty soon you won't be able to tell the Jew from the Wasp, anyway [audience laughter]. It's getting more disconcerting all the time how similar certain things are between me and Eli Mandel [audience laughter]. I just hope he's a very good person and lives a long life and has great success in the future [audience laughter]. The main thing I want to read tonight is a little bit like Eli's last poem [audience laughter]. But it takes a lot more time to get itself said, for good or ill, and I'd like to read a few, a couple shorter poems anyway, before starting that longer poem which takes up a fair amount of the time. I'll read the first book from the, I mean...[laughter], I'll read the first poem from the book which old oriental George Bowering told you about at the beginning of the program.

It starts with a Latin title, it's a kind of letter, actually written in reply to a letter to somebody who accused me of being rather complacent when ironically enough, I felt anything but that at that time. Accused me of being one of the people who didn't have any troubles in life, or not only me but somebody else too, when we had quite a few of our own that were not too dissimilar from those that the other person was talking about. It's about marriage. It's called, to avoid looking too obvious, \"De Profundis Conjugii Vox et Responsum''. It's a serious poem though, more or less.\n \nD.G.

Jones\n00:16:44\nThis poem is the long poem I referred to, it's a kind of confessional poem, it's only about, I suppose, ten years behind Robert Lowell [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q981448] and the other American poets who have been writing what the critics now call confessional poetry, which is about par, I suppose. This poem was more or less actually complete several years ago, but I got so many things into the poem I wasn't sure how I was going to get out. And I've dickied around with it and possibly added a few more things, and finally I kept what I had in the end anyway, which was simply a way of ducking out I suspect. Though I hope there's some kind of peculiar relationship to the end, and everything else. I haven't been able to find a title for it. \"Night Thoughts\", might do, but somebody used that. But it's something along this line: the situation, the scheme is to present a kind of series of reminiscences, mediations, memories which disintegrate and become a little more peculiar as time goes on. Then suddenly stops, breaks off with morning. And it's set more or less around my cottage that I had, in Ontario, which wasn't far from where I was born. This is written in sections but I won't bother reading all the numbers, I'll just pause and go on.\n \nD.G. Jones\n00:19:00\nReads unnamed poem.\n \nD.G.

He completed his B.A. at McGill University in 1952 and an M.A. at Queen\u2019s University in 1954, writing a thesis on Ezra Pound. Jones\u2019 first poems were encouraged by Louis Dudek and Raymond Souster in his publications in Contact Press and Delta. His first collection of poetry, Frost on the Sun (Contact Press, 1957) was followed by The Sun is Axeman (University of Toronto Press, 1961), Phrases from Orpheus (Oxford University Press, 1967) and a winner of a Governor General\u2019s Award for Poetry, Under the Thunder of the Flowers Light Up the Earth (Coach House Press, 1977), A Throw of Particles (General Publishing Company, 1983), Balthazar (Coach House Press, 1988) and The floating garden (Coach House Press, 1995). Jones taught first at the Royal Military College from 1954-5, the Ontario Agricultural College from 1955-1961, he moved to Quebec and taught at Bishop\u2019s University from 1961-1963, and finally at the Universite de Sherbooke, from 1963-1994. His book, Butterfly on rock: a study of themes and images in Canadian literature (University of Toronto Press, 1970) on Canadian criticism has proven to be important in the shaping of that field's literature. He founded Ellipse in 1969, the only Canadian magazine in which both English and French poetry was reciprocally translated. Jones\u2019 own translations include Paul-Marie Lapointe\u2019s The terror of the snows (University of Pittsburgh Press, 1976), The march to love: Selected poems of Gaston Miron (International Poetry Forum, 1986), Normand de Bellefeuille\u2019s Categorics, one, two & three (Coach House Press, 1992) which won the Governor General\u2019s Award for translation and Emile Martel\u2019s For orchestra and solo poet (Muses\u2019 Co, 1996).

He grew up in Regina, until the Second World War when he joined the Army Medical Corps. Upon his return, he studied at the University of Saskatchewan, earning his B.A. in 1949, going on to complete his M.A. in 1950. Mandel then moved east, where he received a Ph.D. in 1957 from the University of Toronto. His early poetry was published in magazines like CIV\/N and Contact, and in 1954 Contact Press published his collection \u201cMinotaur poems\u201d in Trio with Gael Turnbull and Phyllis Webb. Mandel taught English at College Militaire Royal de Saint Jean, University of Alberta and York University in Toronto, as well as serving as visiting professor and writer-in-residence later on in his career. He also wrote many important essays on Canadian literature, art and society, promoting Canadian writers. Poetry 62 (Ryerson Press, 1961), Mandel\u2019s first anthology, co-edited with Jean-Guy Pilon, collected the works of (then) little-known writers Al Purdy, Milton Acorn, D.G. Jones, Alden Nowlan, Leonard Cohen and John Robert Colombo. His second collection of poems was published in Fuseli Poems (Contact Press, 1960), followed by Black and Secret Man (Ryerson Press, 1964), and An Idiot Joy (Hurtig Press, 1967), which won the Governor General\u2019s award. A collection of eight essays by Mandel that had been presented as radio talks for CBC was published in Criticism: the silent-speaking words in 1966 (CBC). His later anthologies include Five modern Canadian poets (Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1970), English poems of the twentieth century (Macmillan, 1971), Contexts of Canadian Criticism (University of Chicago Press, 1971), Eight more Canadian poets (Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1972), and Poets of contemporary Canada: 1960-1970 (Macmillan, 1972) which published Joe Rosenblatt and bill bissett\u2019s first collections of poetry. Mandel\u2019s other works include Stony Plain (Porcepic Press, 1973), Crusoe (Anansi, 1973), Out of Place (Porcepic Press, 1977), the long poem Mary Midnight (Coach House Press, 1979), Life Sentence (Porcepic Press, 1981), Dreaming backwards: selected poems (General Publishing, 1981), the collections of essays Another Time (Porcepic, 1977), and The family romance (Turnstone, 1986) as well as a book-length study of his colleague, Irving Layton called The Poetry of Irving Layton (Coles, 1969). An important figure in Canadian literature, Eli Mandel died in Toronto on September 3, 1992."

Two weeks from tonight, March the 21st at 9 o\u2019clock. in Room 653, [Barnes (?)] willing, there will be a program, I guess within the auspices of the Fine Arts department, the Ira Cohen [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1097790], New York [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60] film maker, and poet will be showing three of his films, as far as I know for the first time in Montreal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q340]. That's two weeks tonight at 9 in 653. When I was asked to introduce Eli Mandel [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3050883], and D.G. Jones [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5203595], I said, 'that's ridiculous', Canadian poetry being the way it is, they already know each other. And after the moment of hilarity I was brought to my senses, and I began to think that it really did make a lot of sense that we do have Doug Jones and Eli Mandel reading on the same program. I can remember in 1961 when Poetry 62 came out, Canadian poetry being the way it is [audience laughter], Poetry 62 was edited by Jean-Guy Pilon [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3166089] I believe and Eli Mandel, being a bilingual book, and at the time the poem that struck me as the most interesting was the long poem by D.G. Jones, the most interesting in that anthology, and I therefore, felt kind of warm, without having them, to both of them to Doug's poem and Eli's great taste for putting it in the anthology. And then I thought that there was this kind of confluence going on and I began to see all kinds of other things happening too, for instance, they both had their first books published by Contact Press, that published the first books of most of the important Canadian poets, and they now have seen their careers sort of criss-cross one another in a kind of a funny way because they each have three books, except that Eli has three and a third, which is also kind of Canadian, and I thought it was kind of interesting because not only is there a kind of parallel going on, and they both in 1967, for instance, turned out very good books of poetry, but there's a kind of uh, they'll be kind of an interesting contrast I think in tonight's program because I've always considered that Doug Jones is sort of the best of the Ontario [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1904] Wasp poets [audience laughter], and Eli Mandel is the best of the Western Jewish poets and they both deal with essential problems that seem to expose their two opposing and therefore contrary and conjugal, you might almost say, attitudes towards the business of writing poems. So we're going to start off with Eli's reading, and then have something like a ten minute break, and then we'll have Doug Jones' reading. I should mention that of those two books, Eli's is called An Idiot Joy and it shared the Governor General's Award [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q283256] given in 1968, and published by Hurtig, Edmonton [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2096] publisher, who is very pleased to get the Governor General's Award, and Doug Jones' book is Phrases from Orpheus, published by Oxford Press [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q217595], two books that would be well worth investing both your heaven, forbid, money and your imagination upon. I'm probably not going to say anything before D.G. Jones comes to read, so I'm not expecting to come up here and spout for five or ten minutes before he reads and I'm not going to spout any longer before Eli reads. So I'd first like to introduce to you Mr. Eli Mandel.\n\nAudience\n00:05:01\nApplause. \n \nEli Mandel\n00:05:29\nI think George [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1239280] might have carried the parallel of contrasts and comparisons a little further had he wanted to, or chosen to, or had he known about certain very intimate details about Doug's life and my life. But I don't propose to go into those myself right now either [audience laughter]. Instead, I'm going to read, primarily from An Idiot Joy, but also from Black and Secret Man, which was an earlier book and also from one or two manuscript poems that I've been working on recently. I want to start with a poem called \"Signatures\" and although I can say a lot about a number of poems that I've written, I'm not sure I can say much about this except that as will be obvious to you I think, the imagery is drawn from the Vietnam [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q881] conflict, though I don't know that the poem is necessarily about that. Can you hear me with this mic? Some people at the back are saying 'no'. Can you hear me now?\n \nEli Mandel\n00:07:00\nReads \"Signatures\" [from An Idiot Joy].\n \nEli Mandel\n00:09:27\nThis poem is called \"Neither Here Nor There\".\n \nEli Mandel\n00:09:33\nReads \"Neither Here Nor There\" [published later in Crusoe: Poems Selected and New].\n \nEli Mandel\n00:10:28\nThis is a poem from Black and Secret Man and it's called \"The Direction is North Until the Pole\", and I suppose it's one of the few poems I've written that I would call a Canadian poem, that is to say it draws on a number of specific images from the Canadian landscape and therefore I have to annotate this poem. I have to tell you that the Fleming mentioned in the last line of the poem was once a Minister of Finance in the federal government, that just proves how transient political poems really are. I think all the rest of this should be clear, hockey is a game that's played in Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16].\n \nEli Mandel\n00:11:16\nReads \"The Direction is North Until the Pole\" from Black and Secret Man.\n \nEli Mandel\n00:13:24\nThis is one of my prophetic poems. I think I've written a lot of really prophetic poems. This poem is called \"Departure\" and it tells about leaving Edmonton. Everybody who has read the poem believes that I wrote it when I decided to leave Edmonton, either for the first time or the second time, I've left there twice, as a matter of fact, I didn't write it when I decided to leave in Edmonton, I wrote it when I arrived in Edmonton.\n \nEli Mandel\n00:13:53\nReads \"Departure\" [from Black and Secret Man].\n \nEli Mandel\n00:14:37\nA little poem about one of my perversions, this is about making love to pregnant women, I think, I'm not sure if there's a technical name for that but the perversion appears in the poem. The poem's called \"Cassandra\" and it's about a prophetess, Cassandra [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q170779], you'll remember was the woman that Agamemnon [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q128176]  brought home with him to his wife, Clytemnestra [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q131157], and this, so angered Clytemnestra, aside from the fact that Agamemnon had killed one of their daughters, that she killed Agamemnon, but Cassandra was a Prophetess, like Prophetesses, was given the power to tell the truth and was never believed. Some of the imagery in this poem is taken from the story of Cassandra, and the rest from my perversions.\n \nEli Mandel\n00:15:39\nReads \"Cassandra\" [from Black and Secret Man].\n \nEli Mandel\n00:17:00\nReads \"The Madness of our Polity\" [from An Idiot Joy].\n \nEli Mandel\n00:17:46\n\"Whence Cometh Our Help?\", the title is taken from the Psalms [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q41064], and there are a number of images of the Psalms, in the poem. Or images from the Psalms.\n \nEli Mandel\n00:18:04\nReads \"Whence Cometh Our Help?\" [from An Idiot Joy].\n \nEli Mandel\n00:19:03\nThis poem is called \"Manner of Suicide\", and it's the closest thing I've come to writing a found poem, in that all the material in the poem, the words are taken from two sources, except for the first line. One is Karl Menninger's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3080926] Man Against Himself and the other, the Jewish Daily Prayer Book. There are twenty-six ways listed here of committing suicide, they're all ways that Menninger lists and documents, and he lists them in the order in which I give them here, and this list, which I give, is then followed by some comments he makes about those ways of committing suicide and a passage from the prayer book.\n \nEli Mandel\n00:20:11\nReads \"Manner of Suicide\" [from An Idiot Joy].\n \nEli Mandel\n00:23:24\nIn An Idiot Joy I wrote a number of poems which were, which used two primary images, the image of the moon and the image of the sea, and these are love poems. I suppose the interesting thing in them to me, aside from the personal sense that I feel about them, is that with each of the poems, whether it's with the image of the moon or the image of the sea, or both, I keep trying different technical things in the poetry, and so far as I'm concerned, I've done some more interesting technical things in this than anywhere else, but primarily, the poems talk about the moon and the sea, and seabirds and women and a woman.\n \nEli Mandel\n00:24:30\nReads \"Woman in the Moon\" from An Idiot Joy.\n \nEli Mandel\n00:26:12\nReads \"The Explanations of the Moon\u201d [from An Idiot Joy].\n \nEli Mandel\n00:27:32\nThis is one of the sea poems, in the sequence, called \"Listen, the Sea\", and the title comes from King Lear [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q181598], though actually, I had become aware of it of course when I knew that Keats [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q82083] had written a sonnet using this, but the technique is neither Shakespearean nor Keatsean, nothing of the kind.\n \nEli Mandel\n00:28:00\nReads \"Listen, the Sea\" [from An Idiot Joy].\n \nEli Mandel\n00:29:01\nAnd \"Marina\", who is a daughter of the sea.\n \nEli Mandel\n00:29:09\nReads \"Marina\" [from An Idiot Joy].\n \nEli Mandel\n00:30:46\nWell something quite different. I think I should dedicate this to George Bowering, because I wrote the poem after I had been\u2026\n\nUnknown\n00:30:56\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n\nEli Mandel\n00:30:57\nAnd I would have to apologize for this, but the last thing in the world that I wanted to do was apologize, I'd prefer anything but that, I mean this is pretty simple-minded simplistic psychology, of the worst order I suppose, I just--I'm writing a poem about how stupid I felt at that particular moment.\n \nEli Mandel\n00:31:17\nReads \"The Apology\" [from An Idiot Joy].\n \nEli Mandel\n00:34:34\nThis is the poem I like to think of as the one that one would put in a time capsule, it's called \"Letter to be Opened Later\" and presumably each one of us wants to immortalize oneself, and imagine, you know, two thousand years later the time capsule being opened and then they can read your letter. This is my letter, to be opened later.\n \nEli Mandel\n00:35:12\nReads \"Letter to be Opened Later\" [published later in Crusoe: Poems Selected and New ].\n \nEli Mandel\n00:36:09\nI'm going to read a lyric, it's a very short poem, but I'd like to read this one anyhow. It's called \"To My Children\" and it's based upon both an odd and rather terrifying coincidence in my life and a curious Jewish tradition. The Jewish tradition is that you name a child after the nearest dead relative, the relative who has died most recently and who is closest to one, and it so happened that my mother died, my daughter was born, my father died and my son was born. And I wrote this poem about the naming of the children. It's called \"To My Children\".\n \nEli Mandel\n00:37:08\nReads \"To My Children\" [from Black and Secret Man].\n \nEli Mandel\n00:38:00\nNow I'm going to finish this reading with two poems, one is called \"The Meaning of the I Ching\" and the other \"Cosmos: the Giant Rose\"--three poems, I'm sorry. I'm going to read \"Pictures in an Institution\" as well. \"The Meaning of the I Ching\", the I Ching [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q181937] as you probably know is a book of divination, it's the oldest book of divination known, and when I first heard about it, I looked at the book before I opened it and I wondered about the very simple notion of a book that old telling my future. How could I be contained in this ancient book? And I wrote this poem. Now it seems to me that there is something remarkable here, it's one claim I will make for the poem, at least, in the poem, is the first time I used the phrase \"earth upon earth\" and the very first hexagram that I cast when I opened the book. The book tells fortunes with what are called hexagrams and hexagrams are given various names, the very first one that I cast was the hexagram \"earth upon earth\" and that's simply something that happened whether it means that the poem is prophetic or magical, I don't know.\n \nEli Mandel\n00:39:36\nReads \"The Meaning of the I Ching\" [from An Idiot Joy].\n \nEli Mandel\n00:43:18\nI'm going to finish now reading \"Pictures in an Institution\". This is the most personal poem I've ever written, and I don't want to read anything after that, so I'm going to finish with this. \"Pictures in an Institution\". I think all I need to say about this is that it plays off notices against some personal experiences and I think that'll be plain enough.\n \nEli Mandel\n00:43:43\nReads \"Pictures in an Institution\" [from Trio: First Poems by Gael Turnbull, Phyllis Webb, and Eli Mandel].\n\nEli Mandel\n00:47:40\nThank you.\n\nAudience\n00:47:41\nApplause.\n\nUnknown\n00:47:51\n[Cut or edit made in tape.

Jones\n00:48:60\nI'm going to do this because I'm thirsty. It's a little disturbing but I've had a suspicion that this was becoming true for some time, in the last few years, that pretty soon you won't be able to tell the Jew from the Wasp, anyway [audience laughter]. It's getting more disconcerting all the time how similar certain things are between me and Eli Mandel [audience laughter]. I just hope he's a very good person and lives a long life and has great success in the future [audience laughter]. The main thing I want to read tonight is a little bit like Eli's last poem [audience laughter]. But it takes a lot more time to get itself said, for good or ill, and I'd like to read a few, a couple shorter poems anyway, before starting that longer poem which takes up a fair amount of the time. I'll read the first book from the, I mean...[laughter], I'll read the first poem from the book which old oriental George Bowering told you about at the beginning of the program. This poem's called \"The Perishing Bird\".\n \nD.G. Jones\n00:51:12\nReads \"The Perishing Bird\" [from Phrases from Orpheus].\n \nD.G.

It starts with a Latin title, it's a kind of letter, actually written in reply to a letter to somebody who accused me of being rather complacent when ironically enough, I felt anything but that at that time. Accused me of being one of the people who didn't have any troubles in life, or not only me but somebody else too, when we had quite a few of our own that were not too dissimilar from those that the other person was talking about. It's about marriage. It's called, to avoid looking too obvious, \"De Profundis Conjugii Vox et Responsum''. It's a serious poem though, more or less.\n \nD.G.

This poem was more or less actually complete several years ago, but I got so many things into the poem I wasn't sure how I was going to get out. And I've dickied around with it and possibly added a few more things, and finally I kept what I had in the end anyway, which was simply a way of ducking out I suspect. Though I hope there's some kind of peculiar relationship to the end, and everything else. I haven't been able to find a title for it. \"Night Thoughts\", might do, but somebody used that. But it's something along this line: the situation, the scheme is to present a kind of series of reminiscences, mediations, memories which disintegrate and become a little more peculiar as time goes on. Then suddenly stops, breaks off with morning. And it's set more or less around my cottage that I had, in Ontario, which wasn't far from where I was born.

Can you hear me? Can you all hear me? Okay. Well, I haven't really a great deal to say, I wanted to say simply that I met Robin Blaser in June of 1964, the occasion was the usual round of parties and a rather un-memorable reading, and a marvelous day out into the countryside, and I also had on that occasion the pleasure of meeting two very close friends of his, Stan Persky [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2330087] and Jack Spicer [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3805658]. I'll read you this little sort of resume of his career. He was born in Idaho [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1221], and he studied at Northwestern [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q309350] and Berkeley [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q168756], and was a librarian at Harvard [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q13371] from 1955 to '59. He now teaches in exile at Simon Fraser University [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q201603], has made an important contribution to the San Francisco poetry renaissance in the '50's and the '60's, and was one of a triumvirate, with Duncan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q964391] and Spicer, that fulminated the serial poem on the poetry scene. Among his own serial poems are \u201cThe Faerie Queene\u201d and \u201cImage-Nation\u201d. His verse has been published in a number of contemporary poetry anthologies. They include, among many, Donald Allen's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5293963] The New American Poetry [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7753501], the Penguin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3374730] New Writing in the United States, and A Controversy of Poets. And among his volumes of poetry are The Boston Poems 1956-58, The Moth Poem, Les Chimeres, and Cups. He is the editor of a West Coast magazine called the Pacific Nation. Now, Robin? Please read for us.\n \nAudience\n00:02:56\nApplause.\n \nRobin Blaser\n00:03:00\nThe marvelous thing about that list of books is that The Boston Poems, in fact, I think I will read one of those, was published and I decided I didn't like the book so there's one copy in the world and I own that copy. So I'm not sure it's fair, to call that a book. I don't think I--but I think I will read, open with that, it now dates back so many years, back to the Boston [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q100] world, when [Jack] Spicer, and [John] Wieners [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1702153] and I were there together, and a very different scene from anything. [Charles] Olson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q922978] was at Black Mountain [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2413277], and Wieners in the centre at Boston.

He moved to California where he received his B.A. in 1952, his M.A. in 1955 and a M.L.S. in 1956 from the University of California at Berkeley. Here he met poets Jack Spicer and Robert Duncan, the three playing major roles in the San Francisco Poetry Renaissance. Blaser, however, next to the dominant figures of Spicer and Duncan, was hesitant to identify himself as a poet and only began publishing his poetry close to twenty years later despite the fact that he was writing poetry already. His work appeared in smaller presses and received restricted attention because of this. After graduating from Berkley, Blaser worked at a number of libraries across the country, including the Widener Library in Boston where he met other East Coast poets, such as Charles Olson and John Wieners. His first larger publication was The Moth Poem (Open Space, 1964). In 1966, he moved to Vancouver, to teach at the Simon Fraser University, and became a Canadian Citizen in 1974. There, Blaser became a strong mentor and influence on the younger poets of the emerging Vancouver Poetry scene of the 60\u2019s, influencing Daphne Marlatt, bp Nichol, Erin Mour\u00e9, and Steve McCaffery. His next collections of poetry followed, with Cups (Four Seasons Foundation, 1968), Image Nations 1-12; and The Stadium of the Mirror (Ferry Press, 1974), Image Nations 13 &14 (Cobblestone Press, 1975), Image Nation 15: The Lacquerhouse (W. Hoffer, 1981), Syntax (Talonbooks, 1983) and his most popular publication nominated for a Governor General\u2019s Award, The Holy Forest (Coach House Press, 1993). Blaser was also an essayist, and published important essays such as \u201cThe Fire\u201d (1967), \u201cThe Violets: Charles Olson and Alfred North Whitehead\u201d (1983), \u201cRobert Duncan, The \u2018Elf\u2019 of It\u201d (1992), \u201cThe Recovery of the Public World\u201d (1993), \u201cPreface to the Early Poems of Robert Duncan\u201d (1995), most of which are collected in The Fire: Collected Essays of Robin Blaser (University of California Press, 2006). Blaser became a Professor of Emeritus at Simon Fraser University and retired in 1986. Blaser was honoured the Order of Canada in 2005, and the Griffin Poetry prize for lifetime achievement in 2006, the Griffin Prize for poetry in 2008, as well as an honourary doctorate by Simon Fraser University in March 2009. After a battle with cancer, Robin Blaser died in Vancouver on May 7th, 2009."

                "contents": "Roy Kiyooka\n00:00:00\nIt's my pleasure this evening to introduce to you Robin Blaser [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2115003], recently of Vancouver [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q24639], and a little bit before that, from San Francisco [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q62] and elsewhere. Can you hear me? Can you all hear me? Okay. Well, I haven't really a great deal to say, I wanted to say simply that I met Robin Blaser in June of 1964, the occasion was the usual round of parties and a rather un-memorable reading, and a marvelous day out into the countryside, and I also had on that occasion the pleasure of meeting two very close friends of his, Stan Persky [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2330087] and Jack Spicer [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3805658]. I'll read you this little sort of resume of his career. He was born in Idaho [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1221], and he studied at Northwestern [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q309350] and Berkeley [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q168756], and was a librarian at Harvard [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q13371] from 1955 to '59. He now teaches in exile at Simon Fraser University [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q201603], has made an important contribution to the San Francisco poetry renaissance in the '50's and the '60's, and was one of a triumvirate, with Duncan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q964391] and Spicer, that fulminated the serial poem on the poetry scene. Among his own serial poems are \u201cThe Faerie Queene\u201d and \u201cImage-Nation\u201d. His verse has been published in a number of contemporary poetry anthologies. They include, among many, Donald Allen's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5293963] The New American Poetry [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7753501], the Penguin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3374730] New Writing in the United States, and A Controversy of Poets. And among his volumes of poetry are The Boston Poems 1956-58, The Moth Poem, Les Chimeres, and Cups. He is the editor of a West Coast magazine called the Pacific Nation. Now, Robin? Please read for us.\n \nAudience\n00:02:56\nApplause.\n \nRobin Blaser\n00:03:00\nThe marvelous thing about that list of books is that The Boston Poems, in fact, I think I will read one of those, was published and I decided I didn't like the book so there's one copy in the world and I own that copy. So I'm not sure it's fair, to call that a book. I don't think I--but I think I will read, open with that, it now dates back so many years, back to the Boston [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q100] world, when [Jack] Spicer, and [John] Wieners [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1702153] and I were there together, and a very different scene from anything. [Charles] Olson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q922978] was at Black Mountain [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2413277], and Wieners in the centre at Boston. This poem is \"The Hunger of Sound\", and the date of it would be 1956. \n \nRobin Blaser\n00:03:54\nReads \"The Hunger of Sound\" from The Boston Poems [collected later in The Holy Forest].\n\nRobin Blaser\n00:10:38\nNow I, I'm a little confused because I've changed the reading now because it was very nice to have people ask for things, so I think I'll read \"Cups\", which is a...I've worked since 1960 on a book called The Holy Forest and that is composed of several serial poems, the first of which is \"Cups\", and that is followed by one called \"The Park\", and one called \"The Faerie Queen\", then \"The Moth Poem\", and then the, then there is a group, translated from G\u00e9rard de Nerval [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q191305], \"Les Chimeres\", which is also a serial poem, and finally a group called \"The Holy Forest\", an unfinished group, and I thought I would read \"Cups\" and then a section, do a little thing on my poetics, an intermission, and then read, if you still are with me, the section I've just finished, called \"The Holy Forest\". This is \"Cups\".\n \nRobin Blaser\n00:11:47\nReads \"Cups\" [from Cups]. \n\nRobin Blaser\n00:22:58\nNow I'm going to move to my essay called \"The Fire\", which is meant to, is meant to talk about what people call poetics, I guess. It certainly talks about what I intend to do, what I am doing. \n \nRobin Blaser\n00:23:28\nReads \"The Fire\" [published later in The Fire: Collected Essays of Robin Blaser].\n \nUnknown\n00:31:57\n[Cut or edit made in tape.

Rosenthal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6723336] said, a little while ago in the Reporter that Duncan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q57421163] was the best of the poets in the experimental tradition and Warren Tolman says he's the best poet writing in the English Language, and I'd probably go further than that. And it's the reading we've been waiting for, most of us, all year, so I'd like to give him as much time as there possibly is. Robert Duncan.\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:00:44\nIn the early 50's, I belonged to a, not a group, because as a matter of fact we were scattered, some in Europe and some in America and didn't know each other, but we were all reacting to a, we all had response of a feeling of poetic responsibility and also a poetic mission, arising out of our response to the publication of Ezra Pound's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q163366] \"Pisan Cantos\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2701465] and the publication that came year after year of the parts of William Carlos Williams's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q178106] \"Paterson\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7017378] but in the same period in magazines, some of the poetry of the later William Carlos Williams was appearing. And it does interest me, although the command of the Modernists had been to write in a natural speech, that in response to features that were appearing in Williams more than Pound, because Pound's lines are all syntactic utterances, but in Williams there's a kind of enjambment and there was a juncture appearing at the end of lines. And we, we took that juncture over and imposed it upon the language, but even in imposing it, found that we had arrived at something that's quite common indeed in our English speech, the stutter is at one end of it, but it is one of the forms we have when we are emotionally excited and things are broken up into phrases and words become almost painful and impossible to say, and this encounter we explored for some time. Later, I'm going to be reading, in passages, which will bring into question radically something related to his. My poetry developed along lines that I began to see as allied to the collage, things that were appearing in American painting, that is whole elements and bits would be taken from anywhere, and very early, at the time, as a matter of fact that I was writing The Opening of the Field, I viewed myself as a kind of jackdaw of poetry and gave up entirely worrying about if I had any originality or had a voice of my own. I was much more attracted picking up things and building them into something, so I was a weaver, I felt in some ways, almost before I was a speaker, and I was a weaver of voices and did not care, or- I decided well, I happen to be the one who is doing this, so certainly that's one thing that I don't have to have an effort about. There's nothing else that's going to be moving out from here. In passages, you'll find a new feature about that collage, but it's already contained in the thing I was suggesting that we took over- the juncture, Creeley [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q918620] for instance built a whole personal style from that juncture and by making its articulation radical, and forcing it into a depth of an emotional statement, and of course of an intellectual statement, because the whole framework of thought changes. Very striking to us in the very beginning was that form was the content, not, it was very hard to determine it, you could say that it even determined content, there was no cause to effect relationship for us, between form and content. Structure determined the nature of what was to thought, like the structure of a body is to what we are, and we didn't think of them as divided, so we were incarnationists in that sense. I feel very strongly that you'll find that repeatedly a theme of my poetry the incarnation of Christ [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q302], the incarnation of spirit and the body, that spirit, that the divine world is manifest and incarnate, and that in its- led us back to the poem as the incarnation and place in which- the spirit doesn't enter poetry, incarnate, it exists. But it was also a collage and you will hear Greek and French entering this world of a collage, and it will be as reformed as the American language is when it enters my collage. And reformed to American contours, the contours of French, and the contours of Greek disappear, forced back into an American stress system, which I find analogous. The French poets were extremely disturbed when Stravinsky set them, she could not bear to hear [Persephone (?)] and because they all came out, French all came out to be Russian in its entire tonation and the French not very happy when the French language turns up in an intonation. I'm thinking of the Parisian, but no Frenchman's very happy about the French language turning up, turning out to be American or Russian. Now my poetry doesn't turn out to be exactly American either, it turns out to be strictly forced back to conform to my poetic patterns, and Greek is not intoned but is forced into a stress pattern. However, with Greek I'm in for free because there's no man who can say what you do with it anyway. In America, we have one system, in Germany, they have another system, and in England, they have, still, a third system of what to do with vowels and what to do with the whole thing. And there's a controversy about whether you do have pitch or whether you do have stress and that arises from the fact that the Hellenistic Greeks [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q428995] already couldn't figure out exactly what you did with those Greek choruses, and they had to put those marks in to instruct their readers what to do, and we don't know what those marks meant for sure [audience laughter]. But they certainly didn't know what it had been like 500 years before. They did poorer, I take it, than the poorest, and that would include me, informed of us do with Middle English [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q36395], and I guess we're nearer to it than they were. Okay, well, we'll just start out and I want to take a path, I'm going to take a path through beginning with a small group of poems from The Opening of the Field.\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:07:46\nReads \"The Law I Love is Major Mover\u201d from The Opening of the Field.\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:10:44\nWhen I was about 30, a great Medieval Historian was teaching at the University of California [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q184478], where I made my living teaching, typing thesis and term papers when I was really hard out of luck and the rumour was very thick indeed that something extraordinary had happened, I think, and my impression is that Universities kill off scholars today much faster than they- they certainly don't kill off poets, they give them very handsome fees to come for a week or so, but they certainly kill off scholars, but the existence- perhaps only the World War with its refugee professors from Europe brought this kind of scholarship onto the scene at the University of California and I returned to school to take up Medieval Studies. One of the, clearly, in my work I, the one course, and I studied with that man until he left for the Princeton Institute of Advanced Learning, studied for him--with him for two and a half years, the course that most changed my poetry was a course on Medieval law, and the growth of constitutional law, because the very basis of poetry I think is a- of art, is the discovery of laws, the laws that finally we can trace through from those Medieval concepts of law and constant meditations upon law so I'm going to read a couple of more poems of our- in which this concept of law moves. This is \"Structure of Rime XIII\" and it's part of an open construct that is a construct that has nothing in its concept, does not belong to a world of cause or effect. It has a chronology, but its chronology is like our chronological time, that is seen by contemporary physics as an anomaly within a time--within a physical time that cannot possibly have the character of a chronological sequence. The best they can explain is that we must inhabit a thread that is suspended in actual time, because actual physical time cannot really be one directional, and we experience one directional time because we are really caught in some isolated thread, in the medium of time. So in \"Structure of Rime\" I conceive of myself not in a chronology, although I experience it, being human as such, but as entering such a domain in which real law exists and real time exists, and the real form to which the poem refers and from which it derives its form. The real form has no beginning or end, and is much faster, is universal, so the--in writing the poem I do not create a form, but participate in a form which is of the nature that we believe the physical world to be and I am much for a convert of Whitehead's process and reality in which we believe the spiritual world to be. And that's where \"The Structure of Rime\" takes place. When I say 'thirteen',  that's of course, in my own sequence then and I conceive of that sequence as actually existing in a part of the mosaic that does not have the character of sequence.\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:14:29\nReads \"Structure of Rime XIII\" from The Opening of the Field. \n \nRobert Duncan\n00:16:59\nSome time shortly after The Opening of the Field was published, I was invited up to Portland [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6106] by a lawyer and his wife to talk to a small group and I learned in correspondence that he had been attracted to my poetry because of the concepts of law as they move through poems, and so I wrote, for them, the poem called \"The Law\", a series and variation.\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:17:35\nReads \"The Law\" [from Roots and Branches].\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:23:27\nWhen Adams [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q11806] said, \u201cthe which\u201d, meaning, he said, \"Democracy, the which requires the continual exercise of virtue beyond the reach of human infirmity, even in its best estate\" he was writing to Jefferson and talking about something that was absolutely necessary, he did not mean that we could escape from what required what was impossible. We had to live in the impossible, which is where I found myself entirely in concord with certainly a poet understands what it is to live in the impossible. He speaks in the first place in a voice which is impossible for himself to speak in, and before which he must always be a flunk out and in some sense, a political- a poetical failure in relation to what everywhere's own poetics is to point out what is necessary. Let me in relation to the law again, read the opening of a poem that I will be later be reading entire, but I want to bring it in context with these poems and the law, and close it with a John Adams that I discovered only a passage of John Adams that I discovered for myself, only about what, it's two or three years ago, two years ago. \"Reading on Myth\", this was from a book called I think it's called 18th Century Against the Gods, or confronts--The 18th Century Confronts the Gods and the chapter on John Adams's mythology was a fascinating chapter, and this passage of the poem is built up entirely with no interpolations at all of--it's built up to the place where I cease to read it, with no interpolations at all of passages of the marginalia that John Adams writes in an Encyclopedia of Mythology.\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:25:32\nReads [\"John Adams\u2019s Marginalia...\"].\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:26:53\nMove back to another early poem in The Opening of the Field that was formative to, throughout my work and the last I guess it must be, each one of these is about three, this is the last ten years. The Field began in 1956, so it must be the last 14 years. And this poem is written in 1956. Take my coat off. In articulating the line, we were opening up- Pound had very early said [unintelligible] by the musical phrase and as I said, since his phrases were identical with syntactic utterances, with sentence utterances, the phrase is- the phrase is simpler than the phrases we use, where often they are enjambed, where often they disturb the meaning of the sentence and suspend elements so that they operate in various parts we did not want what was called an ambiguity by Mr. [Adams (?)], we wanted a multi-phasic area of meanings which is something very different. We wanted all parts to operate within all other parts. And I think this is a crucial difference from what let's say fascinated the metaphysicals of the post-Eliot [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q37767] period in their idea of ambiguities. We wanted one meaning operating within another meaning and they wanted one meaning secretly giving another meaning, I may have such things too, but I mean it's a very different feeling for us. Certainly they did not have to come to articulate as we did, and with these poems, when I get to, as you'll see in passages, when I get into rhythmic articulations where only my body is intelligent enough to keep them, so I have to throw them back into my hands and to my body, a dance can carry them and a dance is really in a sense, the poem in which I moved straight forward and realized how un-literary this was and not exactly song either, and that this dance centre was going to be for whole sections of poems. So, there's a key poem.\n\nRobert Duncan\n00:29:27\nReads \"The Dance\" [from The Opening of the Field].\n\nUnknown\n00:31:32\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed]. \n\nRobert Duncan\n00:31:33\nResumes reading \"The Dance\" [from The Opening of the Field].\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:32:09.\nSomeone said this evening I probably wouldn't read The Pindar poems, I will. Oh let me sing a song for you, songs, I have a couple of songs that are in books. Songs for me are not that quaint form that, a few of them are like the night nurse's songs, the song the night nurse sang. But a song of the old order and some of the other songs are actual songs, that means when I was writing them, a tune came. And they had only one voice to be in, mine, and we could even say unhappily, but there they were. And startled I was when, this is I think, one of the first songs that came that really belonged in a book of poetry. I had early had some songs in Faust Foutu in a sort of a long play that would never get performed in my mind so I was able to whatever I wanted to in it, and- which is a great kind of play to write, because you don't have to worry about anyone else solving any problems, you can name it, they can be on the moon, or whatever, have no stage dimension problems, but also of course I had no song dimension problems but when I wrote this song, \"Gee, I know I'm going to have to get up and sing it\", well of course now you'll get away with it because how rare you'd hear a poet's voice, unless a poet's already like your happy rock-n-roll singer, which I ain't as you will hear. My idea of song is exceedingly primitive indeed, my impression is very, I think you will hear it in this song, it comes from a brief period in which to much the horror of my theosophical parents, but because we were living in a small town and all your friends went to a Sunday School, I went for several years to a Methodist Sunday school and somebody along the line gave me the hint that hymns would come out much better if I just moved my mouth and didn't join in, happily, the lovely music that was going on and so of course I always wanted to write a hymn and there's something in the Methodist hymnal for sure in the song I'm going to sing. \"A Song of the Old Order\". It's not strictly Methodist in theology, but I meant that it's something of the Methodist hymn. However, I will sing also, by following another song that is certainly Calvinist [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q101849], it's a Halloween song, and like only the scotch can possibly dig out of there- the Calvinist counter hymnal.\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:34:52\nSings \"A Song of the Old Order\" [from The Opening of the Field].\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:38:05\nThat was considerably higher than I've ever tried to do it before. [Audience laughter]. But, like a poem, when you're writing it, when you're in it, you're in for it. You can't re-model it to something you think you might get through with. So I will now do the Pindar poem. That somewhat determines what long poem we're going to do. And since this is the first time I've read here in Montreal, some other places I read, I try and give them new stuff, but I take it outside of some tapes that might be available, you haven't really heard these poems. And this will be the last one from The Opening of the Field. I'll pick up a couple from Roots and Branches and then I will be reading from the current, the Bending the Bow and then after the break I'll read some of the new poems that I've written since Bending the Bow. [Take off Biney's Law (?).] No, this is not the beginning of a Ginsberg [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6711] round [laughter.] \"Beginning with a Line by Pindar\", I am ending up with an exhibition by Ginsberg, [laughter.] We've gotten so [unintelligible] in San Francisco [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q62] since all barriers of all kinds were down you really couldn't compete with the show, so you've got, I mean what to do. Common, ordinary people are just left out, you've got to be somebody extraordinary now to [audience laughter], and poetry has to be my extraordinary thing. Believe me, the rest of me is just me. \"A Poem Beginning with a Line by Pindar\".\n\nRobert Duncan\n00:40:17\nReads \"A Poem Beginning with a Line by Pindar\" [from The Opening of the Field].\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:54:15\nI'll read two poems from--that were requested from Roots and Branches.\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:54:30\nReads [\"Risk\u201d] from Roots and Branches.\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:59:22\nThe other poem I will read from Roots and Branches is \"The Continent\". My poetic thought continuously arises from the ground of my happy and, believe me, wildly misunderstanding readings of contemporary science. And the one real poetic source I have is not a literary magazine but Scientific American [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q39379] which I avidly read. So I'm more likely to be studying language than I am to be studying poems and more likely to be studying the world, than I am to be- well, I can't say that, language and the world get even treatment. The poem \"The Continent\" came from the re-assertion that has come in recent years of evidence which has rebuilt the picture of the continental drift. And I was happy at the coordinates to find that Charles Olson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q922978], who also ransacks the same magazine, but does not have the same misunderstandings of the magazine by any means, we have quite a, we sometimes come to [loggerheads (?) ] in our very positively taken misunderstandings of what is. He also had built sections of \u201cMaximus [Poems]\u201d on the continental drift. I love puns of course right away, and so does he, and if you get my drift in poetry, you will see something of what is revealed when we begin to get the drift of those continents and the fittingness of poetry is of course the logic whereby we identify that the continents originally fitted together and identified the sequence of things that happened. They do fit together, but they must have- I mean, the universe- the Neo-plateness, [unintelligible], well no, it isn't a neo-plate, well, it's a near neo-plate, and it's [unintelligible] Judas [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q81018] refers to the masterpiece which is the Universe, that's the only masterpiece and the rest of us compose masterpieces because we are children of the universe, although we may not recognize that that's what we are doing. Some of us don't have entire respect for what we belong to. \"The Continent\".\n \nRobert Duncan\n01:01:49\nReads \"The Continent\" from Roots and Branches.\n \nUnknown\n01:03:39\n[Cut or edit made in tape.

One note before I read it, the island that we would ordinarily in American call \u2018Leuke\u2019 a [unintelligible], like in Leukemia--leuke. In Greek would be \u2018Lay-okay\u2019 and so I was very alarmed indeed when in this poem, as I was writing it came out \u2018Loy-kay\u2019 and it took me quite some time of sheer stage fright and horror at the mis-pronunciation recall the \u2018Lauke\u2019 in German is the [unintelligible] and so forth in German, and that I have had for years now, for some years now a tape of H.D. [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q236469] reading from her \"Helen in Egypt\", a poem which is really the mother poem of this poem, and not too much hidden in the poem, for those who know of  my closeness to H.D. who was certainly a surrogate mother for me. Thetis of the poem would certainly be the poetess H.D. and in that tape, H.D. who had lived for most of her life from the 20's on in Switzerland, uses the German pronunciation throughout, \u2018Aloike\u2019 and that's how I heard it in association with this poem. So I've finally recognized where it came from but it's an example of the fact that you cannot correct things in poems because it's sewn into a rhyme and absolutely belongs in the music here.

Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n\nRobert Duncan\n01:25:45\nTwo aspects of the art, seem particularly mysteries to me as I've been working at the art of poetry since I was 19 and it's now 30 years. In relation to that thing we call rhyme, meter and so forth, I have come to think more and more that it's ratios and numbers that may be the heart of the matter. And at the same time as I begin to feel that at the heart of the matter, as one begins to, as one does with mysteries, be fearful about approaching the question. Some years ago, two years ago or so, with the poet Zukofsky [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q975481], who knows much more than I do of the art, and performs really awesomely in it, I said it had begun, I said \"Zuk,\u201d I said, \u201cI had begun to feel that it isn't a question about syllables or stresses and so forth, it's a question of numbers\". And he said \"Yes, I've decided by now I ought to, certainly if I don't know syllables and stresses and so forth, by now, I mean know them only in my hand, I certainly shouldn't be thinking about them. And I am now only dealing with 8's. All of these lines are 8's, straight through. I have not yet really phased the initiations of the question of numbers but I know that this is central as one moves into the period of working in the art that I'm in.\" The other thing, and that is that I have indicated it earlier, is that the nature of the time of the art is increasingly mysterious, the one thing I'm sure of it cannot be, positive absolutely defined in one area, for a long time I was doing happily enough with the formula that Christians made for themselves of time and eternity and their term of eternity which is the very present moment of any work of art and is also of course somehow containing the ensemble of all of the things created must also be like that time that physics talks about. That makes them puzzle why in the world our own time goes from a thing we call the past to the future. Whitehead [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q183372] solves it in Process and Reality by suggesting that we create, in every moment that we live a past and a future, and we live in a history consequently because that's what we create what we are, is pastness and future, and sum it up in a material, that is still persuasive. But a mystery is when none of the answers are answers and as long as they're not answers the artist has them as really, forces that move as art. Now I make this remark because, well I said something about chronologies I, in the past I have not read these two poems as they appear in the book, in readings, but I want to read them today and I'm going to just underline the transition I want you to see and share with me at this point. I arranged, for all that what I've said about chronologies, I arranged the poems in my volumes chronologically and largely because it seems to me a mystery as they go and the rhymes appear from one to the other, and one poem will be an announcement of a succeeding poem or themes will flow out of it. The one I'm going to read first is not a \u201cPassages\" it's called \"Reflections\" and at the close, and as a theme of it, you will find the old man, who is as a matter of fact, I structure rhyme preceding it had a fire master appearing, who seems very close indeed to the master of fire, and the poem that came next, it may have been in a couple of weeks of so, this was a very productive period, concludes with a figure of an old man tuning a drum between a bowl of fire and a bowl of water, and it was followed by a \"Passages\" which is called \"The Fire\", and from it we can learn that the fire that you see in \"Passages\" which is catastrophic, and is held in a polarity with an ideogram with the natural world, that that which may have indeed be--is indeed a bowl of water, as you will see, I mean it's a stream of water that the fire is composed between a world of water and its own world of fire, but that fire that looks like a catastrophe you will find is the creative fire--if you go under \"Reflections\" and let the reflections that came first reflect into the poem following. Now these are things that you realize afterwards, in your own chronology. I am one of those poets who has the characteristic I find in my study of Whitman [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q81438] in the last three years that Whitman certainly was another poet who studied himself all the time. We have a great prohibition in our contemporary world against studying yourself, but I am not short on the world of ego, so I'm not really very disturbed about the fact that I study myself in the poetry. But the one thing I search to find is not something we would ordinarily call ourselves, I study the poet, the thing that the poems are creating in order for them to come into being. That I can sharply distinguish from myself. As sharply as you can do it, it takes office, the idea of office, and this again I got from my Medieval Studies. Okay, I'm going to read \"Reflections\" and then I'm going to read \"The Fire\" and then I will, the poems I will be reading from then on will be \"Passages\", \"Fire\" is one of \"Passages\". And \"Passages\" is as I explained, an open form that exists in these other universe of time, of something, like, you call eternity.\n \nRobert Duncan\n01:32:07\nReads \"Reflections\" [from Bending the Bow].\n \nEND\n01:34:38\n\n\nrobert_duncan_i006-11-096-2.mp3 [File 2 of 2] \n\nRobert Duncan\n00:00:00\nReads [\u201cThe Fire, Passages 13 from Bending the Bow; recording begins abruptly].\n \nUnknown\n00:13:11\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed]. \n\nRobert Duncan\n00:13:12\n...beginning with a poem called \"Soldiers\", a poem in which, um, let's see, right, some lines of Victor Hugo [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q535] enter, I decided I should, well, I guess, lets see, no I don't want to read too late, and soldiers is rather long again, so I want- certain themes that are moving in \"Soldiers\" will reappear. In \"Soldiers\", a recurring line was one from a poem of Victor Hugo's, \"Dieu dans [unintelligible] reve\", which is a line really quite in tune with my own poetics, \"God, oh creator the- or the creator for us too in oneself whose dream, whose work goes much further than our dreams\" and so it's combined with a scene that's Vietnam and it's combined in the Soldiers with the theme of the recognition that in some mystery of that work that goes further than our dreams the soldiers in Vietnam most of them, have just there, and they're 19 or 18 and so forth, they have only there in which to make their lives. And they have only there in which to, to take their souls in the war, as the followers of Orpheus take soul in the poem. The wood to take fire from that dirty flame. A recognition that that is their field in which they must reach life's epiphany and its thing. And the line of Victor Hugo carried me forward to and returned me to grand themes of Victor Hugo's but it also took me back to Vietnam [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q881] and I wanted to give, before I read \"The Kao Dai\" a little sketch of that. There's a theme of Victor Hugo, by the way, of the fall of Lucifer [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q185498] in which, Lucifer's falling into his own denial of God and in falling he opens the univ- creation, and but in his falling a feather breaks loose from his wings and is floating mid-air, and the sight of God descending falls upon the feather and it becomes light and it turns into an angel and that angel is Liberty and that angel's entire message is to transform the rage and wrathful light that had fallen upon it into the reunion and resurrection of Satan, but of course both Satan and God must be called from their wrath, to reconciliation, so this angel, Liberty and Freedom is also the angel of reconciliation and Victor Hugo knew that also there must be some explanation for the fact that the desire and yearning for freedom and liberty has always been wrathful. Blake [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q41513] is puzzled by the same thing and I think that today, when all over the world, not only in Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16], but in the United States [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30], and in China [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q29520], and Yugoslavia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q36704] and Russia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q159] the wrath of Liberty is rising and it is the wrath of God against the civilization to its very roots which we know in our hearts are Godless. But that wrath must be reconciled, because it is itself that it's rising against and there's some mystery in this, so my poetry has begun to take up the figure of that angel and the angel comes into it. Now, in Vietnam, one of the strongest forces in the Viet Cong, not a communist group but a religious group, the Cao Dai [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q470364] and in order to read more in deeper into the Cao Dai, I wisely, I think, went back to sources to the early thirties before Vietnam was quite the cause it is today, and found this story and it came quite in line with my kooky family and my own poetry because it was at a medium's table in 1925 on Christmas Eve, when Christ descended and speaking in French, as I usually put it when I read my, something worse than American French, a French man would feel that that was blasphemy, but I'm after all repeating Christ's words in his own voice so that might be more serious yet that that voice was being attempted. Christ came into the medium and renounced in my birth day for the spirit is descending upon Vietnam and when we remember what happened to the very first generation of Christians who were burned in rows as torches, what the promise of Christ meant to his immediate blessing, the powers of martyrdom. The promise of Christ in 1925 was amply fulfilled to his new disciples. So amply, as a matter of fact, the Cao Dai had more than come to my mind, because the cathedral town of Cao Dai, which is [unintelligible] indeed exactly like a Catholic nunnery or convent, or a Buddhist nunnery or convent is Communist, is the province of Tay Ninh [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q36608], and the Cathedral city of Tay Ninh, now it is been repeated over and over in American papers that when those planes were returning for missions in North Vietnam and hadn't dumped their missions, you're not supposed to return any bombs, you gotta dump them somewhere, so they'd dump them on Tay Ninh, you'd just go over the side and dump them on Tay Ninh, because this particular religious group was stubborn indeed in its inherences. Now, also interesting to me was this particular religious group had as its patron Saint Victor Hugo, and the first place that the French are, that the Vietnamese have French as their deepest religious and literary language and so Christ talked in French so Victor Hugo gave the whole line, it's Victor Hugo's Christ who talked to them at the medium tables in French, and they of course had their medium tables in the line of the tradition of Victor Hugo's own medium tables in the Isle of Jersey. So Victor Hugo becomes patron saint for these passages. In the passage, by the way, a passage called \"Orders\" and I will read a passage from it in which I am actually translating from Victor Hugo quite directly but it's a very long poem and keeping in tune with that master of the sublime is very difficult for us in the modern period. Here we are, the passage, wait a minute, it isn't in that poem, I always think it's in \"Orders\", but it's actually in place of a passage 22, that has the passage with Victor Hugo. I have been working on it for years, and it's mainly trying to keep in tune, I go over and over and over it again and then I find it very difficult to deal with 19th century poetry. But this is a passage straight translation, as literal as I could from Victor Hugo, but really, massive poem.\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:21:11\nReads \"The Soldiers\" [from Bending the Bow].\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:22:14\nCharming little poem called the \"Twentieth Century\", in case you want to know where we are.\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:22:22\nReads \"Twentieth Century\" [published as \u201cThe Light, Passages 28\u201d in Bending the Bow].\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:30:27\nI'll close with \"Stage Directions\".\n \nUnknown\n00:30:32\n[Cut or edit made in tape.

                "notes": "American poet Robert Duncan was born on January 7, 1919 in Oakland, California. At birth, he was given his father\u2019s name: Edward Howard Duncan. In 1920 and after his mother\u2019s death shortly after childbirth, Duncan was adopted into another family and re-named. But he adopted the name Robert Duncan when he started publishing his early poems. These poems were published in magazines during his studies at University of California at Berkeley between 1936-1938. He edited the Experimental Review the year following. Duncan then moved to New York where he joined a group of writers which included Anais Nin, George Barker, Henry Miller, and Kenneth Patchen. The poems that he wrote in this period were collected in 1966 for The Years as Catches: First Poems 1939-1946 (Oyez Press) and in 1968 for The First Decade: Selected Poems 1940-1950 (Fulcrum Press). From 1946 to 1950, Duncan moved to San Francisco, where he met and was influenced by poet Jack Spicer. His first collection of published poems was Heavenly and Earthly City (Bern Porter Press, 1947), followed by Poems 1948-49 (Berkeley Miscellany Editions, 1949). In 1948 he enrolled in classes in Medieval and Renaissance Civilization, taught by Ernst Kantorowicz, after which he published Medieval Scenes (Centaur Press) in 1950. The next year he met and began a lifelong relationship with the painter Jess Collins, and by 1955 he published Caesar\u2019s Gate Poems 1949-1950 with Collages by Jess (Divers Press), a collection of poems from the early 50\u2019s. Fragments of a Disordered Devotion was published privately in 1952, only to be re-printed by Toronto\u2019s Island Press in 1966. During this time he also was deeply influenced by the poems of Charles Olson, Robert Creeley and Denise Levertov. Duncan taught at the Black Mountain College in 1956, and published Derivations (1968), poems collected from 1950 to 1956. After spending a year in Mallorca, his play Medea at Kolchis: The Maiden Head was performed at Black Mountain College. Duncan then moved back to San Francisco as the assistant director of the Poetry Center at San Francisco State University.  His most popular collection of poems, The Opening of the Field (Grove Press) was published in 1960, and was re-printed in London by Jonathan Cape in 1969 and in New York by New Directions in 1973. He was associated with the Creative Writing Workshop at the University of British Columbia in 1963, and he held a Guggenheim Fellowship until 1964. Duncan became one of the most vocal poets writing against the Vietnam war, and some of his anti-war poetry was published in pamphlets, collected later in Ground Work: Before the War printed privately in 1971. His later collections include, but are not limited to Roots and Branches, (Scribners, 1964, reprinted by New Directions, 1968, and Johnathan Cape, 1970), Bending the Bow (New Directions, 1968), his last collection of poetry, Ground Work II: In the Dark (New Directions, 1987), and several books of essays including Fictive Certainties (New Directions, 1985). He was the recipient of National Endowment of the Arts grants, the National Poetry Award as well as other honours. Robert Duncan died in 1988, and several of his collections of poetry were published posthumously."

M.L. Rosenthal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6723336] said, a little while ago in the Reporter that Duncan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q57421163] was the best of the poets in the experimental tradition and Warren Tolman says he's the best poet writing in the English Language, and I'd probably go further than that. And it's the reading we've been waiting for, most of us, all year, so I'd like to give him as much time as there possibly is. Robert Duncan.\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:00:44\nIn the early 50's, I belonged to a, not a group, because as a matter of fact we were scattered, some in Europe and some in America and didn't know each other, but we were all reacting to a, we all had response of a feeling of poetic responsibility and also a poetic mission, arising out of our response to the publication of Ezra Pound's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q163366] \"Pisan Cantos\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2701465] and the publication that came year after year of the parts of William Carlos Williams's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q178106] \"Paterson\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7017378] but in the same period in magazines, some of the poetry of the later William Carlos Williams was appearing. And it does interest me, although the command of the Modernists had been to write in a natural speech, that in response to features that were appearing in Williams more than Pound, because Pound's lines are all syntactic utterances, but in Williams there's a kind of enjambment and there was a juncture appearing at the end of lines. And we, we took that juncture over and imposed it upon the language, but even in imposing it, found that we had arrived at something that's quite common indeed in our English speech, the stutter is at one end of it, but it is one of the forms we have when we are emotionally excited and things are broken up into phrases and words become almost painful and impossible to say, and this encounter we explored for some time. Later, I'm going to be reading, in passages, which will bring into question radically something related to his. My poetry developed along lines that I began to see as allied to the collage, things that were appearing in American painting, that is whole elements and bits would be taken from anywhere, and very early, at the time, as a matter of fact that I was writing The Opening of the Field, I viewed myself as a kind of jackdaw of poetry and gave up entirely worrying about if I had any originality or had a voice of my own. I was much more attracted picking up things and building them into something, so I was a weaver, I felt in some ways, almost before I was a speaker, and I was a weaver of voices and did not care, or- I decided well, I happen to be the one who is doing this, so certainly that's one thing that I don't have to have an effort about. There's nothing else that's going to be moving out from here. In passages, you'll find a new feature about that collage, but it's already contained in the thing I was suggesting that we took over- the juncture, Creeley [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q918620] for instance built a whole personal style from that juncture and by making its articulation radical, and forcing it into a depth of an emotional statement, and of course of an intellectual statement, because the whole framework of thought changes. Very striking to us in the very beginning was that form was the content, not, it was very hard to determine it, you could say that it even determined content, there was no cause to effect relationship for us, between form and content. Structure determined the nature of what was to thought, like the structure of a body is to what we are, and we didn't think of them as divided, so we were incarnationists in that sense. I feel very strongly that you'll find that repeatedly a theme of my poetry the incarnation of Christ [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q302], the incarnation of spirit and the body, that spirit, that the divine world is manifest and incarnate, and that in its- led us back to the poem as the incarnation and place in which- the spirit doesn't enter poetry, incarnate, it exists. But it was also a collage and you will hear Greek and French entering this world of a collage, and it will be as reformed as the American language is when it enters my collage. And reformed to American contours, the contours of French, and the contours of Greek disappear, forced back into an American stress system, which I find analogous. The French poets were extremely disturbed when Stravinsky set them, she could not bear to hear [Persephone (?)] and because they all came out, French all came out to be Russian in its entire tonation and the French not very happy when the French language turns up in an intonation. I'm thinking of the Parisian, but no Frenchman's very happy about the French language turning up, turning out to be American or Russian. Now my poetry doesn't turn out to be exactly American either, it turns out to be strictly forced back to conform to my poetic patterns, and Greek is not intoned but is forced into a stress pattern. However, with Greek I'm in for free because there's no man who can say what you do with it anyway. In America, we have one system, in Germany, they have another system, and in England, they have, still, a third system of what to do with vowels and what to do with the whole thing. And there's a controversy about whether you do have pitch or whether you do have stress and that arises from the fact that the Hellenistic Greeks [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q428995] already couldn't figure out exactly what you did with those Greek choruses, and they had to put those marks in to instruct their readers what to do, and we don't know what those marks meant for sure [audience laughter]. But they certainly didn't know what it had been like 500 years before. They did poorer, I take it, than the poorest, and that would include me, informed of us do with Middle English [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q36395], and I guess we're nearer to it than they were. Okay, well, we'll just start out and I want to take a path, I'm going to take a path through beginning with a small group of poems from The Opening of the Field.\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:07:46\nReads \"The Law I Love is Major Mover\u201d from The Opening of the Field.\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:10:44\nWhen I was about 30, a great Medieval Historian was teaching at the University of California [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q184478], where I made my living teaching, typing thesis and term papers when I was really hard out of luck and the rumour was very thick indeed that something extraordinary had happened, I think, and my impression is that Universities kill off scholars today much faster than they- they certainly don't kill off poets, they give them very handsome fees to come for a week or so, but they certainly kill off scholars, but the existence- perhaps only the World War with its refugee professors from Europe brought this kind of scholarship onto the scene at the University of California and I returned to school to take up Medieval Studies. One of the, clearly, in my work I, the one course, and I studied with that man until he left for the Princeton Institute of Advanced Learning, studied for him--with him for two and a half years, the course that most changed my poetry was a course on Medieval law, and the growth of constitutional law, because the very basis of poetry I think is a- of art, is the discovery of laws, the laws that finally we can trace through from those Medieval concepts of law and constant meditations upon law so I'm going to read a couple of more poems of our- in which this concept of law moves. This is \"Structure of Rime XIII\" and it's part of an open construct that is a construct that has nothing in its concept, does not belong to a world of cause or effect. It has a chronology, but its chronology is like our chronological time, that is seen by contemporary physics as an anomaly within a time--within a physical time that cannot possibly have the character of a chronological sequence. The best they can explain is that we must inhabit a thread that is suspended in actual time, because actual physical time cannot really be one directional, and we experience one directional time because we are really caught in some isolated thread, in the medium of time. So in \"Structure of Rime\" I conceive of myself not in a chronology, although I experience it, being human as such, but as entering such a domain in which real law exists and real time exists, and the real form to which the poem refers and from which it derives its form. The real form has no beginning or end, and is much faster, is universal, so the--in writing the poem I do not create a form, but participate in a form which is of the nature that we believe the physical world to be and I am much for a convert of Whitehead's process and reality in which we believe the spiritual world to be. And that's where \"The Structure of Rime\" takes place. When I say 'thirteen',  that's of course, in my own sequence then and I conceive of that sequence as actually existing in a part of the mosaic that does not have the character of sequence.\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:14:29\nReads \"Structure of Rime XIII\" from The Opening of the Field. \n \nRobert Duncan\n00:16:59\nSome time shortly after The Opening of the Field was published, I was invited up to Portland [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6106] by a lawyer and his wife to talk to a small group and I learned in correspondence that he had been attracted to my poetry because of the concepts of law as they move through poems, and so I wrote, for them, the poem called \"The Law\", a series and variation.\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:17:35\nReads \"The Law\" [from Roots and Branches].\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:23:27\nWhen Adams [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q11806] said, \u201cthe which\u201d, meaning, he said, \"Democracy, the which requires the continual exercise of virtue beyond the reach of human infirmity, even in its best estate\" he was writing to Jefferson and talking about something that was absolutely necessary, he did not mean that we could escape from what required what was impossible. We had to live in the impossible, which is where I found myself entirely in concord with certainly a poet understands what it is to live in the impossible. He speaks in the first place in a voice which is impossible for himself to speak in, and before which he must always be a flunk out and in some sense, a political- a poetical failure in relation to what everywhere's own poetics is to point out what is necessary. Let me in relation to the law again, read the opening of a poem that I will be later be reading entire, but I want to bring it in context with these poems and the law, and close it with a John Adams that I discovered only a passage of John Adams that I discovered for myself, only about what, it's two or three years ago, two years ago. \"Reading on Myth\", this was from a book called I think it's called 18th Century Against the Gods, or confronts--The 18th Century Confronts the Gods and the chapter on John Adams's mythology was a fascinating chapter, and this passage of the poem is built up entirely with no interpolations at all of--it's built up to the place where I cease to read it, with no interpolations at all of passages of the marginalia that John Adams writes in an Encyclopedia of Mythology.\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:25:32\nReads [\"John Adams\u2019s Marginalia...\"].\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:26:53\nMove back to another early poem in The Opening of the Field that was formative to, throughout my work and the last I guess it must be, each one of these is about three, this is the last ten years. The Field began in 1956, so it must be the last 14 years. And this poem is written in 1956. Take my coat off. In articulating the line, we were opening up- Pound had very early said [unintelligible] by the musical phrase and as I said, since his phrases were identical with syntactic utterances, with sentence utterances, the phrase is- the phrase is simpler than the phrases we use, where often they are enjambed, where often they disturb the meaning of the sentence and suspend elements so that they operate in various parts we did not want what was called an ambiguity by Mr. [Adams (?)], we wanted a multi-phasic area of meanings which is something very different. We wanted all parts to operate within all other parts. And I think this is a crucial difference from what let's say fascinated the metaphysicals of the post-Eliot [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q37767] period in their idea of ambiguities. We wanted one meaning operating within another meaning and they wanted one meaning secretly giving another meaning, I may have such things too, but I mean it's a very different feeling for us. Certainly they did not have to come to articulate as we did, and with these poems, when I get to, as you'll see in passages, when I get into rhythmic articulations where only my body is intelligent enough to keep them, so I have to throw them back into my hands and to my body, a dance can carry them and a dance is really in a sense, the poem in which I moved straight forward and realized how un-literary this was and not exactly song either, and that this dance centre was going to be for whole sections of poems. So, there's a key poem.\n\nRobert Duncan\n00:29:27\nReads \"The Dance\" [from The Opening of the Field].\n\nUnknown\n00:31:32\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed]. \n\nRobert Duncan\n00:31:33\nResumes reading \"The Dance\" [from The Opening of the Field].\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:32:09.\nSomeone said this evening I probably wouldn't read The Pindar poems, I will. Oh let me sing a song for you, songs, I have a couple of songs that are in books. Songs for me are not that quaint form that, a few of them are like the night nurse's songs, the song the night nurse sang. But a song of the old order and some of the other songs are actual songs, that means when I was writing them, a tune came. And they had only one voice to be in, mine, and we could even say unhappily, but there they were. And startled I was when, this is I think, one of the first songs that came that really belonged in a book of poetry. I had early had some songs in Faust Foutu in a sort of a long play that would never get performed in my mind so I was able to whatever I wanted to in it, and- which is a great kind of play to write, because you don't have to worry about anyone else solving any problems, you can name it, they can be on the moon, or whatever, have no stage dimension problems, but also of course I had no song dimension problems but when I wrote this song, \"Gee, I know I'm going to have to get up and sing it\", well of course now you'll get away with it because how rare you'd hear a poet's voice, unless a poet's already like your happy rock-n-roll singer, which I ain't as you will hear. My idea of song is exceedingly primitive indeed, my impression is very, I think you will hear it in this song, it comes from a brief period in which to much the horror of my theosophical parents, but because we were living in a small town and all your friends went to a Sunday School, I went for several years to a Methodist Sunday school and somebody along the line gave me the hint that hymns would come out much better if I just moved my mouth and didn't join in, happily, the lovely music that was going on and so of course I always wanted to write a hymn and there's something in the Methodist hymnal for sure in the song I'm going to sing. \"A Song of the Old Order\". It's not strictly Methodist in theology, but I meant that it's something of the Methodist hymn. However, I will sing also, by following another song that is certainly Calvinist [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q101849], it's a Halloween song, and like only the scotch can possibly dig out of there- the Calvinist counter hymnal.\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:34:52\nSings \"A Song of the Old Order\" [from The Opening of the Field].\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:38:05\nThat was considerably higher than I've ever tried to do it before. [Audience laughter]. But, like a poem, when you're writing it, when you're in it, you're in for it. You can't re-model it to something you think you might get through with. So I will now do the Pindar poem. That somewhat determines what long poem we're going to do. And since this is the first time I've read here in Montreal, some other places I read, I try and give them new stuff, but I take it outside of some tapes that might be available, you haven't really heard these poems. And this will be the last one from The Opening of the Field. I'll pick up a couple from Roots and Branches and then I will be reading from the current, the Bending the Bow and then after the break I'll read some of the new poems that I've written since Bending the Bow. [Take off Biney's Law (?).] No, this is not the beginning of a Ginsberg [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6711] round [laughter.] \"Beginning with a Line by Pindar\", I am ending up with an exhibition by Ginsberg, [laughter.] We've gotten so [unintelligible] in San Francisco [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q62] since all barriers of all kinds were down you really couldn't compete with the show, so you've got, I mean what to do. Common, ordinary people are just left out, you've got to be somebody extraordinary now to [audience laughter], and poetry has to be my extraordinary thing. Believe me, the rest of me is just me. \"A Poem Beginning with a Line by Pindar\".\n\nRobert Duncan\n00:40:17\nReads \"A Poem Beginning with a Line by Pindar\" [from The Opening of the Field].\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:54:15\nI'll read two poems from--that were requested from Roots and Branches.\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:54:30\nReads [\"Risk\u201d] from Roots and Branches.\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:59:22\nThe other poem I will read from Roots and Branches is \"The Continent\". My poetic thought continuously arises from the ground of my happy and, believe me, wildly misunderstanding readings of contemporary science. And the one real poetic source I have is not a literary magazine but Scientific American [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q39379] which I avidly read. So I'm more likely to be studying language than I am to be studying poems and more likely to be studying the world, than I am to be- well, I can't say that, language and the world get even treatment. The poem \"The Continent\" came from the re-assertion that has come in recent years of evidence which has rebuilt the picture of the continental drift. And I was happy at the coordinates to find that Charles Olson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q922978], who also ransacks the same magazine, but does not have the same misunderstandings of the magazine by any means, we have quite a, we sometimes come to [loggerheads (?) ] in our very positively taken misunderstandings of what is. He also had built sections of \u201cMaximus [Poems]\u201d on the continental drift. I love puns of course right away, and so does he, and if you get my drift in poetry, you will see something of what is revealed when we begin to get the drift of those continents and the fittingness of poetry is of course the logic whereby we identify that the continents originally fitted together and identified the sequence of things that happened. They do fit together, but they must have- I mean, the universe- the Neo-plateness, [unintelligible], well no, it isn't a neo-plate, well, it's a near neo-plate, and it's [unintelligible] Judas [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q81018] refers to the masterpiece which is the Universe, that's the only masterpiece and the rest of us compose masterpieces because we are children of the universe, although we may not recognize that that's what we are doing. Some of us don't have entire respect for what we belong to. \"The Continent\".\n \nRobert Duncan\n01:01:49\nReads \"The Continent\" from Roots and Branches.\n \nUnknown\n01:03:39\n[Cut or edit made in tape.

It's a song from my Halloween masque.

Okay, well a few things, but you might be missing them anyway.\n \nRobert Duncan\n01:10:39\nReads \"Transgressing the Real, Passages 27\" [from Bending the Bow].\n \nRobert Duncan\n01:14:14\nReads \"Epilogos\" [from Bending the Bow].\n\nRobert Duncan\n01:20:57\nNow the one poem from, poetry I've written since then, a poem called \"Achilles' Song\". One note before I read it, the island that we would ordinarily in American call \u2018Leuke\u2019 a [unintelligible], like in Leukemia--leuke. In Greek would be \u2018Lay-okay\u2019 and so I was very alarmed indeed when in this poem, as I was writing it came out \u2018Loy-kay\u2019 and it took me quite some time of sheer stage fright and horror at the mis-pronunciation recall the \u2018Lauke\u2019 in German is the [unintelligible] and so forth in German, and that I have had for years now, for some years now a tape of H.D. [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q236469] reading from her \"Helen in Egypt\", a poem which is really the mother poem of this poem, and not too much hidden in the poem, for those who know of  my closeness to H.D. who was certainly a surrogate mother for me. Thetis of the poem would certainly be the poetess H.D. and in that tape, H.D. who had lived for most of her life from the 20's on in Switzerland, uses the German pronunciation throughout, \u2018Aloike\u2019 and that's how I heard it in association with this poem. So I've finally recognized where it came from but it's an example of the fact that you cannot correct things in poems because it's sewn into a rhyme and absolutely belongs in the music here. Play it differently--I mean, it's what fits a poem not what fits some other system outside the poem that the poem must adhere to. Okay, \"Achilles' Song\".\n \nRobert Duncan\n01:22:44 \nReads \"Achilles' Song\".\n\nUnknown\n01:25:05\n[Cut or edit made in tape.

Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n\nRobert Duncan\n01:25:45\nTwo aspects of the art, seem particularly mysteries to me as I've been working at the art of poetry since I was 19 and it's now 30 years. In relation to that thing we call rhyme, meter and so forth, I have come to think more and more that it's ratios and numbers that may be the heart of the matter. And at the same time as I begin to feel that at the heart of the matter, as one begins to, as one does with mysteries, be fearful about approaching the question. Some years ago, two years ago or so, with the poet Zukofsky [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q975481], who knows much more than I do of the art, and performs really awesomely in it, I said it had begun, I said \"Zuk,\u201d I said, \u201cI had begun to feel that it isn't a question about syllables or stresses and so forth, it's a question of numbers\". And he said \"Yes, I've decided by now I ought to, certainly if I don't know syllables and stresses and so forth, by now, I mean know them only in my hand, I certainly shouldn't be thinking about them. And I am now only dealing with 8's. All of these lines are 8's, straight through. I have not yet really phased the initiations of the question of numbers but I know that this is central as one moves into the period of working in the art that I'm in.\" The other thing, and that is that I have indicated it earlier, is that the nature of the time of the art is increasingly mysterious, the one thing I'm sure of it cannot be, positive absolutely defined in one area, for a long time I was doing happily enough with the formula that Christians made for themselves of time and eternity and their term of eternity which is the very present moment of any work of art and is also of course somehow containing the ensemble of all of the things created must also be like that time that physics talks about. That makes them puzzle why in the world our own time goes from a thing we call the past to the future. Whitehead [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q183372] solves it in Process and Reality by suggesting that we create, in every moment that we live a past and a future, and we live in a history consequently because that's what we create what we are, is pastness and future, and sum it up in a material, that is still persuasive. But a mystery is when none of the answers are answers and as long as they're not answers the artist has them as really, forces that move as art. Now I make this remark because, well I said something about chronologies I, in the past I have not read these two poems as they appear in the book, in readings, but I want to read them today and I'm going to just underline the transition I want you to see and share with me at this point. I arranged, for all that what I've said about chronologies, I arranged the poems in my volumes chronologically and largely because it seems to me a mystery as they go and the rhymes appear from one to the other, and one poem will be an announcement of a succeeding poem or themes will flow out of it. The one I'm going to read first is not a \u201cPassages\" it's called \"Reflections\" and at the close, and as a theme of it, you will find the old man, who is as a matter of fact, I structure rhyme preceding it had a fire master appearing, who seems very close indeed to the master of fire, and the poem that came next, it may have been in a couple of weeks of so, this was a very productive period, concludes with a figure of an old man tuning a drum between a bowl of fire and a bowl of water, and it was followed by a \"Passages\" which is called \"The Fire\", and from it we can learn that the fire that you see in \"Passages\" which is catastrophic, and is held in a polarity with an ideogram with the natural world, that that which may have indeed be--is indeed a bowl of water, as you will see, I mean it's a stream of water that the fire is composed between a world of water and its own world of fire, but that fire that looks like a catastrophe you will find is the creative fire--if you go under \"Reflections\" and let the reflections that came first reflect into the poem following. Now these are things that you realize afterwards, in your own chronology. I am one of those poets who has the characteristic I find in my study of Whitman [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q81438] in the last three years that Whitman certainly was another poet who studied himself all the time. We have a great prohibition in our contemporary world against studying yourself, but I am not short on the world of ego, so I'm not really very disturbed about the fact that I study myself in the poetry. But the one thing I search to find is not something we would ordinarily call ourselves, I study the poet, the thing that the poems are creating in order for them to come into being. That I can sharply distinguish from myself. As sharply as you can do it, it takes office, the idea of office, and this again I got from my Medieval Studies. Okay, I'm going to read \"Reflections\" and then I'm going to read \"The Fire\" and then I will, the poems I will be reading from then on will be \"Passages\", \"Fire\" is one of \"Passages\". And \"Passages\" is as I explained, an open form that exists in these other universe of time, of something, like, you call eternity.\n \nRobert Duncan\n01:32:07\nReads \"Reflections\" [from Bending the Bow].\n \nEND\n01:34:38\n",

Unknown amount of time elapsed]. \n\nRobert Duncan\n00:13:12\n...beginning with a poem called \"Soldiers\", a poem in which, um, let's see, right, some lines of Victor Hugo [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q535] enter, I decided I should, well, I guess, lets see, no I don't want to read too late, and soldiers is rather long again, so I want- certain themes that are moving in \"Soldiers\" will reappear. In \"Soldiers\", a recurring line was one from a poem of Victor Hugo's, \"Dieu dans [unintelligible] reve\", which is a line really quite in tune with my own poetics, \"God, oh creator the- or the creator for us too in oneself whose dream, whose work goes much further than our dreams\" and so it's combined with a scene that's Vietnam and it's combined in the Soldiers with the theme of the recognition that in some mystery of that work that goes further than our dreams the soldiers in Vietnam most of them, have just there, and they're 19 or 18 and so forth, they have only there in which to make their lives. And they have only there in which to, to take their souls in the war, as the followers of Orpheus take soul in the poem. The wood to take fire from that dirty flame. A recognition that that is their field in which they must reach life's epiphany and its thing. And the line of Victor Hugo carried me forward to and returned me to grand themes of Victor Hugo's but it also took me back to Vietnam [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q881] and I wanted to give, before I read \"The Kao Dai\" a little sketch of that. There's a theme of Victor Hugo, by the way, of the fall of Lucifer [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q185498] in which, Lucifer's falling into his own denial of God and in falling he opens the univ- creation, and but in his falling a feather breaks loose from his wings and is floating mid-air, and the sight of God descending falls upon the feather and it becomes light and it turns into an angel and that angel is Liberty and that angel's entire message is to transform the rage and wrathful light that had fallen upon it into the reunion and resurrection of Satan, but of course both Satan and God must be called from their wrath, to reconciliation, so this angel, Liberty and Freedom is also the angel of reconciliation and Victor Hugo knew that also there must be some explanation for the fact that the desire and yearning for freedom and liberty has always been wrathful. Blake [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q41513] is puzzled by the same thing and I think that today, when all over the world, not only in Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16], but in the United States [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30], and in China [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q29520], and Yugoslavia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q36704] and Russia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q159] the wrath of Liberty is rising and it is the wrath of God against the civilization to its very roots which we know in our hearts are Godless. But that wrath must be reconciled, because it is itself that it's rising against and there's some mystery in this, so my poetry has begun to take up the figure of that angel and the angel comes into it. Now, in Vietnam, one of the strongest forces in the Viet Cong, not a communist group but a religious group, the Cao Dai [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q470364] and in order to read more in deeper into the Cao Dai, I wisely, I think, went back to sources to the early thirties before Vietnam was quite the cause it is today, and found this story and it came quite in line with my kooky family and my own poetry because it was at a medium's table in 1925 on Christmas Eve, when Christ descended and speaking in French, as I usually put it when I read my, something worse than American French, a French man would feel that that was blasphemy, but I'm after all repeating Christ's words in his own voice so that might be more serious yet that that voice was being attempted. Christ came into the medium and renounced in my birth day for the spirit is descending upon Vietnam and when we remember what happened to the very first generation of Christians who were burned in rows as torches, what the promise of Christ meant to his immediate blessing, the powers of martyrdom. The promise of Christ in 1925 was amply fulfilled to his new disciples. So amply, as a matter of fact, the Cao Dai had more than come to my mind, because the cathedral town of Cao Dai, which is [unintelligible] indeed exactly like a Catholic nunnery or convent, or a Buddhist nunnery or convent is Communist, is the province of Tay Ninh [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q36608], and the Cathedral city of Tay Ninh, now it is been repeated over and over in American papers that when those planes were returning for missions in North Vietnam and hadn't dumped their missions, you're not supposed to return any bombs, you gotta dump them somewhere, so they'd dump them on Tay Ninh, you'd just go over the side and dump them on Tay Ninh, because this particular religious group was stubborn indeed in its inherences. Now, also interesting to me was this particular religious group had as its patron Saint Victor Hugo, and the first place that the French are, that the Vietnamese have French as their deepest religious and literary language and so Christ talked in French so Victor Hugo gave the whole line, it's Victor Hugo's Christ who talked to them at the medium tables in French, and they of course had their medium tables in the line of the tradition of Victor Hugo's own medium tables in the Isle of Jersey. So Victor Hugo becomes patron saint for these passages. In the passage, by the way, a passage called \"Orders\" and I will read a passage from it in which I am actually translating from Victor Hugo quite directly but it's a very long poem and keeping in tune with that master of the sublime is very difficult for us in the modern period. Here we are, the passage, wait a minute, it isn't in that poem, I always think it's in \"Orders\", but it's actually in place of a passage 22, that has the passage with Victor Hugo. I have been working on it for years, and it's mainly trying to keep in tune, I go over and over and over it again and then I find it very difficult to deal with 19th century poetry. But this is a passage straight translation, as literal as I could from Victor Hugo, but really, massive poem.\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:21:11\nReads \"The Soldiers\" [from Bending the Bow].\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:22:14\nCharming little poem called the \"Twentieth Century\", in case you want to know where we are.\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:22:22\nReads \"Twentieth Century\" [published as \u201cThe Light, Passages 28\u201d in Bending the Bow].\n \nRobert Duncan\n00:30:27\nI'll close with \"Stage Directions\".\n \nUnknown\n00:30:32\n[Cut or edit made in tape.

And for those of you who are here for the first time, welcome you too. I'm really glad that we could start off with Jerome Rothenberg [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1775056], especially from my own personal viewpoint, because while Jerome Rothenberg is one of the names that I've paid a lot of attention to, and one of the names that poets have paid attention to over the last decade, this'll be the first time that I've been able to hear him read, too. Usually when, often when us people from the West think about the new American poetry, we tend to think of it in terms of people from outposts such as New Mexico [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1522], and Utah, [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q829] and San Francisco [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q62], and so on. And we forget that New York City [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60] is one of the centre-place, central-places, so that it can produce poets such as Joel Oppenheimer [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6213806] who will be here in the following spring, and Paul Blackburn [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7149388], who was here a couple of years ago. Jerome Rothenberg has always been the centre, in the centre of that scene, and not only as one of the principal poets, but as editor, and publisher, and so on and so forth, especially with a very important magazine of the 1960's called some--oblique thing [some\/thing]. And he's especially interesting to me too because of the kind of work that produced a book such as Technicians of the Sacred, a compilation of the poetries from various oral traditions around the world, and a similar sort of impulse has always been at the centre of his work too. I'd also like to correct a mistake on the little printed page that wasn't really mine, that I picked up from somewhere else and couldn't quite believe myself, that said that Jerome Rothenberg was born in 1921. All I can say is that he was born sometime between the death of Lord Byron [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5679] and now. [Laughter]. But I'm pretty certain that he wasn't around in 1921. So I'd like you to give a welcome to Jerome Rothenberg.\n \nAudience\n00:02:53\nApplause.\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:02:58\nThe birthdate'll come clearer in the second part of the reading. I'll read in two parts. And in the first set, what I'll be reading are translations and re-workings of American Indian poetry, which have been important to me over the last five or six years. And I'll start with some which are based on earlier translations, re-workings of material previously translated, and then as I get into it, some translations that result from direct contact and direct experience of American Indian poetry. This is an Aztec poem. The first four or five, six poems will be Aztec or Mexican in origin, and the theme will be flowers.  \"Offering Flowers\".\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:04:24\nReads \"Offering Flowers\" [from Technicians of the Sacred].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:07:37\nThis is Aztec, too, in origin, translated through the Spanish.\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:07:52\nReads \u201cA Song of Chalco\u201d [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:09:53\nAnd it doesn't die out, even with the destruction that follows, and flowers are picked up again, this in a series of translations, again through the Spanish, of a series of Peyote songs, from the Huichol Indians of central Mexico [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q96]. The name Wirikuta [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q8026952] is the name given to the place of the gods, and the spiritual place of the Peyote. The Peyote is described as the rose, it's described as the corn, the maize, it's described under a number of images, and through the figure, the mythological figure of one called the Blue Stag. This is the first Huichol, Peyote song.\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:10:46\nReads \u201cFirst Peyote Song\u201d [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:11:46.19\n\"Song of an Initiate\".\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:11:51\nReads \"Song of an Initiate\" [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:12:25\nAnd this is a poem called \"How the Violin Was Born: A Peyote Account\u201d.\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:12:35\nReads \"How the Violin was Born: A Peyote Account\u201d [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:13:24\nThese are a few short Indian pieces. Not poems but part of what's connected with the whole activity of poetry, among the tribal peoples. Which is more than an activity of words; which goes beyond language. And these are the events that accompany the words. And the first is an Iroquois dream event. \n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:13:58\nReads [\"Dream Event 1\", published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:14:08\nThese are a series of vision events. The first two are Eskimo.\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:14:14\nReads \"Vision Event I\" [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n\nJerome Rothenberg\n00:14:25\nReads \"Vision Event 2\" [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:14:39\nAnd this is a Sioux Indian vision event.\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:14:43\nReads \"Vision Event 3\" [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:15:01\nThis is a Kwakiutl Indian gift event. All the words are from Kwakiut'l Indians. It's either spoken in English or translated into English. The Kwakiut'l, like other Northwest Coast people, celebrate the potlatch, you know, which is not always terrible or distasteful in its consequences. This is benevolent gift-giving. \n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:15:26\nReads \"Gift Event [2]\" [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:16:32\nThese are a series of seven Navajo animal songs. \n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:16:42\nReads \"Navajo Animal Songs\" [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:17:49\nThe next few are from a series of translations I've been doing, are called, well, it's the Seneca Indian word for one of their major curing ceremonies, a term for a major curing ceremony, \"Shaking the Pumpkin\", because the pumpkin rattle, the big pumpkin rattle is the major instrument used in this. Or it's got a more ornate name, it's called \"The Society of the Mystic Animals\". The man, Richard Johnny John, Indian, who is working with me on this, explained it's a serious ceremony, he said, but if everything's alright, the one who says the prayer tells them, I leave it up to you, folks, and if you want to have a good time, have a good time. Well everything's alright in the translations, you know, so one eases up there. The translations are done trying to follow everything in the Seneca, including the meaning of the sounds, the hey-ya and the way-oh-hey, that are very common in Indian poetry. Basically the way I do it is to present them visually on the page, and I can't do this in reading them, so I'm just going to select out of these poems that read easily. The purpose is curing, and well-being. \n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:19:34\nReads [\"Caw Caw the Crows Caw Caw\" published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:19:49\nReads \"Two more about a crow, in the manner of Zukofsky\" [later published in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:20:05\nThree poems about the owl, on the page, the vocables, the sounds, make the figure of an owl, even as in the singing of the song, the sound of the owl comes through. But here are just the words.\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:20:19\nReads \"The Owl: One\".\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:20:25\nReads \"The Owl: Two\".\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:20:32\nReads \"The Owl: Three\".\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:20:40\n\"A Song of My Song, In Three Parts\u201d.\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:20:45\nReads \"A Song of My Song, In Three Parts\" [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:20:59\nReads \u201cThree Ways to Screw Up on Your Way to the Doings\u201d [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:21:16\nBuckets are important, to bring back soup and...The last one from this series.\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:21:31\nReads \u201cWhere the Song Went Where She Went & What Happened When they Met\u201d [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:22:15\nThe next are a little harder to do, but I hope I make it. The Senecas don't use many words. It's a kind of minimal poetry and the power is in the compression. The Navajos use more words, the poetry gets dense, and in addition they use many many non-verbal sounds. And in addition, they distort many of the words in the singing. So that if you translate just for the meaning, you're only getting a small part of what the Navajo is doing. And then in addition, everything is sung in the Navajo. So I began to translate a series called, because that's what they are, \"The Seventeen Horse Songs of Frank Mitchell\". Seventeen horse-blessing, horse-curing songs that were the property of a Navajo medicine man named Frank Mitchell. And the problem that came up for me, I couldn't translate just for meaning, I wanted to, you know, consider all of the factors that went into the poem. So I began to insert sounds corresponding to the sound of the English words as the Navajo had the meaning of the sounds, and to distort the words. And then it seemed to me that it was necessary to carry this further, to begin to sing the songs as well. Which came to me with great difficulty. But I've gotten through a number of them now, and what I'll do is sing one, the \"Tenth Horse Song of Frank Mitchell,\" and then do a tape for three voices of another one of the horse songs. You'll notice the words are rather similar from one to another, the melody changes. In this, and the Navajos of course would know this, the hero, Enemy-Slayer, has gone to the house of his father, the sun up there, to bring back horses for the people. And in this Tenth Horse Song, it's mostly the father, the sun, speaking, telling him to bring the horses back to the house of his mother, you know, who everybody understands to be Changing Woman. Bring it back to the earth. And sometimes the voice of Enemy-Slayer comes into it.  But the basic refrain is to \"go to the woman, go to her.\" \n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:25:24\nPerforms \"Tenth Horse Song of Frank Mitchell\" [from The 17 Horse-Songs of Frank Mitchell]. \n \nAudience\n00:31:25\nApplause.\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:31:38\nThe next one, and I guess the last piece in the first set, is the \"Twelfth Horse Song of Frank Mitchell\". The melody changes. Some of the distortions change. The burden changes, and now Enemy-Slayer contemplates the horses coming back to earth with him, in the same sequence. This is done on tape, with three voices. I think that's about all there is to say about it. Three voices.\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:32:23\nPlays recording of \"Twelfth Horse Song of Frank Mitchell\", sung by three voices [from The 17 Horse-Songs of Frank Mitchell and published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n \nAudience\n00:39:42\nApplause.\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:39:48\nIn fact, let me end this set with a live poem, I don't want to end with a machine. This is another Aztec poem called \"The Flight of Quetzalcoatl\". The plumed serpent, bird-snake man. In which he discovers that he's become old, and leaves and goes on a long journey, and is reborn as the morning star.\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:40:39\nReads \"The Flight of Quetzalcoatl\" [later published in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n \nAudience\n00:47:17\nApplause. \n \nUnknown\n00:47:20\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:47:20\nOkay, we'll hold for about ten minutes, and open the doors and get cool, and then come back. \n \nUnknown\n00:47:27\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:47:28\nThe second set will be a straight reading, whatever that means, from a long series of poems called \"Poland\/1931\". A series of ancestral poems. So Poland [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q36] is where the ancestors come from, for some number, hundreds of years. And that is Jewish Poland. And 1931, rather than 1921, is the year of my birth. And it's in a sense, though I don't keep to it too strictly, everything before that. To try to build up a world that I really don't know.\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:48:29\nReads \"Poland\/1931: The Wedding\" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:50:46\nReads \"The King of the Jews\" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:51:52\nThe next one's called \"The Key of Solomon\". It's the name of a medieval, a series of medieval magical books that were supposed to go back to the times of Solomon [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q37085]. \n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:57:07\nReads \"The Key of Solomon\" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:53:42\n\"The Beadle's Testimony.\" Because beadles were a demon.\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:53:47\nReads \"The Beadle's Testimony\" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:54:53\nTwo poems called \"Soap\".\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:54:57\nReads \"Soap \" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:55:56\nReads \"Soap II\u201d [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:57:37\nReads \"The Rabbi's Testimony\" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:59:08\nReads \"The Connoisseur of Jews\" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:00:38\nReads \"The Beards\" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:03:32\nReads \"The Mothers I\" [from Poland\/1931]. \n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:04:08\nReads \"The Mothers II\" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:04:43\nReads \"The Mothers III\" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:05:19\nReads \"Milk & Honey I\" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:06:00\nReads \"Milk & Honey II\" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:06:31\nReads \"Ancestral Scenes\" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:07:09\nReads \"The Fathers\" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:09:10\nThis one is called \"Portrait of the Jew, Old Country Style\".\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:09:16\nReads \"Poland, 1931: Portrait of the Jew, Old Country Style\" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:11:51\nThis is a longer one, called \"The Student's Testimony\"\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:12:04\nReads \"The Student's Testimony\" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:17:49\nA somewhat shorter one, and then another long one, and then a quite short one and that's...that's it. \n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:17:58\nReads \"The Brothers\" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:20:10\nReads \"The Steward's Testimony\" [from Poland\/1931].\n\nAudience\n01:25:15\nLaughter and applause [faint].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:25:20\nNow, I'll end it with, I'll end it with two poems. \"A Poem for the Christians\". It's partly to...[Audience laughter]...it's a found poem from the prayer book. But you can see where there are changes, you know. [Audience laughter].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:25:42\nReads \"A Poem for the Christians\" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:26:45\nReads \"Fish and Paradise\".\n \nEND\n01:27:32\n[Cut off abruptly]."

                "notes": "American poet, teacher, translator, performance artist and editor Jerome Rothenberg was born in New York City in 1931. He received his B.A. in 1952 from the City College of New York and his M.A. in 1953 from the University of Michigan. Directly after graduation, Rothenberg enrolled in the military and served until 1955. He then worked on additional graduate work at Columbia University from 1956-1959. Rothenberg\u2019s first collection of poetry, White Sun Black Sun (1960) was published through the small press Hawk\u2019s Well Press, which he founded in 1958 to promote the works of young poets. He also edited the magazine Poems from a Floating World which ran from 1959-1964. At that time, Rothenberg began a long and influential career as a teacher of both Literature and Visual Arts; he worked at the City College of New York (1960-61), the Mannes College of Music (1961-1970), the University of California, San Diego (1971), and at the New School for Social Research (1971-72). Along with his poetry, Rothenberg translated the works of German postwar poets Paul Celan, Gunter Grass and Ingeborg Bachman; the translations influenced many of the poets of the Beat movement. Rothenberg then published his own poetry in The Seven Hells of the Jigoku Zoshi (Trobar, 1962), Sightings (Hawk\u2019s Well, 1964), The Gorky Poems (El Corno Emplumado, 1966), Between: 1960-1963 (Fulcrum, 1967), Poland\/1931, Part I (Unicorn Press, 1969), Poems for the Game of Silence (Dial, 1970), Seneca Journal, Midwinter (Singing Bone, 1975) and his popular anthology Shaking the Pumpkin: Traditional Poetry of the Indian North Americas (Doubleday, 1972). Rothenberg then taught at the University of Wisconsin (1974-77), the University of California, San Diego (1977-85), the State University of New York (SUNY) at Albany in 1986 and at Binghamton from 1986-1988, and finally at the University of California, San Diego. More of his poetry collections include Narratives and Realtheater Pieces (Braad, 1978), Poems for the Society of the Mystic Animals (Tetrad, 1979), Abulafia\u2019s Circles (Membrane, 1979), Vienna Blood (New Directions, 1983), Altar Piece (Station Hill, 1982), That Dada Strain (New Directions, 1983), Khurbn & Other Poems (New Directions, 1989), Lorca Variations (New Directions, 1993) which won the PEN Oakland Josephine Miles Literary Award in 1994, Seedings (New Directions, 1996) and A Paradise of Poets (New Directions, 1999). Rothenberg has won, among many other honors, the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research grant in 1968, fellowships fro the Guggenheim Foundation in 1974 and the National Endowment for the Arts in 1976. His first collection of essays on poetics, Pre-Faces (New Directions, 1982) won the American Book Award that same year. Rothenberg continues to teach in the Visual Arts and Literature Departments, as a Professor Emeritus at the University of California at San Diego."

                "contents": "George Bowering\n00:00:00\nI'm glad we got this room. Welcome back to the first night of the fourth year of our series. And for those of you who are here for the first time, welcome you too. I'm really glad that we could start off with Jerome Rothenberg [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1775056], especially from my own personal viewpoint, because while Jerome Rothenberg is one of the names that I've paid a lot of attention to, and one of the names that poets have paid attention to over the last decade, this'll be the first time that I've been able to hear him read, too. Usually when, often when us people from the West think about the new American poetry, we tend to think of it in terms of people from outposts such as New Mexico [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1522], and Utah, [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q829] and San Francisco [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q62], and so on. And we forget that New York City [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60] is one of the centre-place, central-places, so that it can produce poets such as Joel Oppenheimer [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6213806] who will be here in the following spring, and Paul Blackburn [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7149388], who was here a couple of years ago. Jerome Rothenberg has always been the centre, in the centre of that scene, and not only as one of the principal poets, but as editor, and publisher, and so on and so forth, especially with a very important magazine of the 1960's called some--oblique thing [some\/thing]. And he's especially interesting to me too because of the kind of work that produced a book such as Technicians of the Sacred, a compilation of the poetries from various oral traditions around the world, and a similar sort of impulse has always been at the centre of his work too. I'd also like to correct a mistake on the little printed page that wasn't really mine, that I picked up from somewhere else and couldn't quite believe myself, that said that Jerome Rothenberg was born in 1921. All I can say is that he was born sometime between the death of Lord Byron [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5679] and now. [Laughter]. But I'm pretty certain that he wasn't around in 1921. So I'd like you to give a welcome to Jerome Rothenberg.\n \nAudience\n00:02:53\nApplause.\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:02:58\nThe birthdate'll come clearer in the second part of the reading. I'll read in two parts. And in the first set, what I'll be reading are translations and re-workings of American Indian poetry, which have been important to me over the last five or six years. And I'll start with some which are based on earlier translations, re-workings of material previously translated, and then as I get into it, some translations that result from direct contact and direct experience of American Indian poetry. This is an Aztec poem. The first four or five, six poems will be Aztec or Mexican in origin, and the theme will be flowers.  \"Offering Flowers\".\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:04:24\nReads \"Offering Flowers\" [from Technicians of the Sacred].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:07:37\nThis is Aztec, too, in origin, translated through the Spanish.\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:07:52\nReads \u201cA Song of Chalco\u201d [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:09:53\nAnd it doesn't die out, even with the destruction that follows, and flowers are picked up again, this in a series of translations, again through the Spanish, of a series of Peyote songs, from the Huichol Indians of central Mexico [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q96]. The name Wirikuta [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q8026952] is the name given to the place of the gods, and the spiritual place of the Peyote. The Peyote is described as the rose, it's described as the corn, the maize, it's described under a number of images, and through the figure, the mythological figure of one called the Blue Stag. This is the first Huichol, Peyote song.\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:10:46\nReads \u201cFirst Peyote Song\u201d [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:11:46.19\n\"Song of an Initiate\".\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:11:51\nReads \"Song of an Initiate\" [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:12:25\nAnd this is a poem called \"How the Violin Was Born: A Peyote Account\u201d.\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:12:35\nReads \"How the Violin was Born: A Peyote Account\u201d [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:13:24\nThese are a few short Indian pieces. Not poems but part of what's connected with the whole activity of poetry, among the tribal peoples. Which is more than an activity of words; which goes beyond language. And these are the events that accompany the words. And the first is an Iroquois dream event. \n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:13:58\nReads [\"Dream Event 1\", published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:14:08\nThese are a series of vision events. The first two are Eskimo.\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:14:14\nReads \"Vision Event I\" [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n\nJerome Rothenberg\n00:14:25\nReads \"Vision Event 2\" [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:14:39\nAnd this is a Sioux Indian vision event.\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:14:43\nReads \"Vision Event 3\" [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:15:01\nThis is a Kwakiutl Indian gift event. All the words are from Kwakiut'l Indians. It's either spoken in English or translated into English. The Kwakiut'l, like other Northwest Coast people, celebrate the potlatch, you know, which is not always terrible or distasteful in its consequences. This is benevolent gift-giving. \n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:15:26\nReads \"Gift Event [2]\" [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:16:32\nThese are a series of seven Navajo animal songs. \n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:16:42\nReads \"Navajo Animal Songs\" [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:17:49\nThe next few are from a series of translations I've been doing, are called, well, it's the Seneca Indian word for one of their major curing ceremonies, a term for a major curing ceremony, \"Shaking the Pumpkin\", because the pumpkin rattle, the big pumpkin rattle is the major instrument used in this. Or it's got a more ornate name, it's called \"The Society of the Mystic Animals\". The man, Richard Johnny John, Indian, who is working with me on this, explained it's a serious ceremony, he said, but if everything's alright, the one who says the prayer tells them, I leave it up to you, folks, and if you want to have a good time, have a good time. Well everything's alright in the translations, you know, so one eases up there. The translations are done trying to follow everything in the Seneca, including the meaning of the sounds, the hey-ya and the way-oh-hey, that are very common in Indian poetry. Basically the way I do it is to present them visually on the page, and I can't do this in reading them, so I'm just going to select out of these poems that read easily. The purpose is curing, and well-being. \n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:19:34\nReads [\"Caw Caw the Crows Caw Caw\" published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:19:49\nReads \"Two more about a crow, in the manner of Zukofsky\" [later published in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:20:05\nThree poems about the owl, on the page, the vocables, the sounds, make the figure of an owl, even as in the singing of the song, the sound of the owl comes through. But here are just the words.\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:20:19\nReads \"The Owl: One\".\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:20:25\nReads \"The Owl: Two\".\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:20:32\nReads \"The Owl: Three\".\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:20:40\n\"A Song of My Song, In Three Parts\u201d.\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:20:45\nReads \"A Song of My Song, In Three Parts\" [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:20:59\nReads \u201cThree Ways to Screw Up on Your Way to the Doings\u201d [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:21:16\nBuckets are important, to bring back soup and...The last one from this series.\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:21:31\nReads \u201cWhere the Song Went Where She Went & What Happened When they Met\u201d [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:22:15\nThe next are a little harder to do, but I hope I make it. The Senecas don't use many words. It's a kind of minimal poetry and the power is in the compression. The Navajos use more words, the poetry gets dense, and in addition they use many many non-verbal sounds. And in addition, they distort many of the words in the singing. So that if you translate just for the meaning, you're only getting a small part of what the Navajo is doing. And then in addition, everything is sung in the Navajo. So I began to translate a series called, because that's what they are, \"The Seventeen Horse Songs of Frank Mitchell\". Seventeen horse-blessing, horse-curing songs that were the property of a Navajo medicine man named Frank Mitchell. And the problem that came up for me, I couldn't translate just for meaning, I wanted to, you know, consider all of the factors that went into the poem. So I began to insert sounds corresponding to the sound of the English words as the Navajo had the meaning of the sounds, and to distort the words. And then it seemed to me that it was necessary to carry this further, to begin to sing the songs as well. Which came to me with great difficulty. But I've gotten through a number of them now, and what I'll do is sing one, the \"Tenth Horse Song of Frank Mitchell,\" and then do a tape for three voices of another one of the horse songs. You'll notice the words are rather similar from one to another, the melody changes. In this, and the Navajos of course would know this, the hero, Enemy-Slayer, has gone to the house of his father, the sun up there, to bring back horses for the people. And in this Tenth Horse Song, it's mostly the father, the sun, speaking, telling him to bring the horses back to the house of his mother, you know, who everybody understands to be Changing Woman. Bring it back to the earth. And sometimes the voice of Enemy-Slayer comes into it.  But the basic refrain is to \"go to the woman, go to her.\" \n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:25:24\nPerforms \"Tenth Horse Song of Frank Mitchell\" [from The 17 Horse-Songs of Frank Mitchell]. \n \nAudience\n00:31:25\nApplause.\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:31:38\nThe next one, and I guess the last piece in the first set, is the \"Twelfth Horse Song of Frank Mitchell\". The melody changes. Some of the distortions change. The burden changes, and now Enemy-Slayer contemplates the horses coming back to earth with him, in the same sequence. This is done on tape, with three voices. I think that's about all there is to say about it. Three voices.\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:32:23\nPlays recording of \"Twelfth Horse Song of Frank Mitchell\", sung by three voices [from The 17 Horse-Songs of Frank Mitchell and published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n \nAudience\n00:39:42\nApplause.\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:39:48\nIn fact, let me end this set with a live poem, I don't want to end with a machine. This is another Aztec poem called \"The Flight of Quetzalcoatl\". The plumed serpent, bird-snake man. In which he discovers that he's become old, and leaves and goes on a long journey, and is reborn as the morning star.\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:40:39\nReads \"The Flight of Quetzalcoatl\" [later published in Shaking the Pumpkin].\n \nAudience\n00:47:17\nApplause. \n \nUnknown\n00:47:20\n[Cut or edit made in tape.

Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:47:28\nThe second set will be a straight reading, whatever that means, from a long series of poems called \"Poland\/1931\". A series of ancestral poems. So Poland [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q36] is where the ancestors come from, for some number, hundreds of years. And that is Jewish Poland. And 1931, rather than 1921, is the year of my birth. And it's in a sense, though I don't keep to it too strictly, everything before that. To try to build up a world that I really don't know.\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:48:29\nReads \"Poland\/1931: The Wedding\" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:50:46\nReads \"The King of the Jews\" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:51:52\nThe next one's called \"The Key of Solomon\". It's the name of a medieval, a series of medieval magical books that were supposed to go back to the times of Solomon [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q37085]. \n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:57:07\nReads \"The Key of Solomon\" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:53:42\n\"The Beadle's Testimony.\" Because beadles were a demon.\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:53:47\nReads \"The Beadle's Testimony\" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:54:53\nTwo poems called \"Soap\".\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:54:57\nReads \"Soap \" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:55:56\nReads \"Soap II\u201d [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:57:37\nReads \"The Rabbi's Testimony\" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n00:59:08\nReads \"The Connoisseur of Jews\" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:00:38\nReads \"The Beards\" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:03:32\nReads \"The Mothers I\" [from Poland\/1931]. \n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:04:08\nReads \"The Mothers II\" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:04:43\nReads \"The Mothers III\" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:05:19\nReads \"Milk & Honey I\" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:06:00\nReads \"Milk & Honey II\" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:06:31\nReads \"Ancestral Scenes\" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:07:09\nReads \"The Fathers\" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:09:10\nThis one is called \"Portrait of the Jew, Old Country Style\".\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:09:16\nReads \"Poland, 1931: Portrait of the Jew, Old Country Style\" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:11:51\nThis is a longer one, called \"The Student's Testimony\"\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:12:04\nReads \"The Student's Testimony\" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:17:49\nA somewhat shorter one, and then another long one, and then a quite short one and that's...that's it. \n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:17:58\nReads \"The Brothers\" [from Poland\/1931].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:20:10\nReads \"The Steward's Testimony\" [from Poland\/1931].\n\nAudience\n01:25:15\nLaughter and applause [faint].\n \nJerome Rothenberg\n01:25:20\nNow, I'll end it with, I'll end it with two poems. \"A Poem for the Christians\".

                "notes": "Poet, artist, painter and editor bill bissett was born in Halifax in 1939, but was most actively associated with the Vancouver poetry renaissance of the 60s. He has often been associated with bpNichol as a founder of the concrete poetry movement and a sound poetry practitioner. bissett has published dozens of collections of poems over thirty years, many of them self-published with his own art on the cover. A selection of his titles include we sleep inside each other all published in 1966 by Island press, which was followed by awake in the red desert (TalonBooks, 1968), selected poems: nobody owns th earth (House of Anansi Press, 1971), pomes for yoshi (blewointmentpress,1972), Medicine my mouths on fire (Oberon Press, 1974), Sailor (TalonBooks, 1978), Seagull on Yonge Street (TalonBooks, 1983), Canada gees mate for life (TalonBooks, 1985), Animal uproar (TalonBooks, 1987), Hard 2 beleev (TalonBooks, 1990), Th last photo uv th human soul (TalonBooks, 1993), Th influenza uv logik (TalonBooks, 1995). bissett founded Vancouver\u2019s blewointmentpress in 1963. His poetry and alternative lifestyle often caused bissett to have legal problems, which rallied support from his community. what we have (TalonBooks, 1988) won the Milton Acorn People\u2019s Poetry Award in 1989, and much of his art and activism privileges the democracy of poetry. He is most famous for his poetry readings, as his printed text lifts off the page through chanting, visual and sound poetry techniques. bissett currently lives in London, Ontario."

                "notes": "Poet, revolutionary, and Beat generation icon Allen Ginsberg was born on June 3, 1926 in Paterson, New Jersey, to Naomi, a radical communist, and Louis Ginsberg, teacher and lyric poet. In his early life, Ginsberg\u2019s mother was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, a condition that would forever shape her son\u2019s life. After graduation from high school, Ginsberg was accepted to Columbia University on scholarship to study labor law. However, after meeting Mark Van Doren and Lionel Trilling, Ginsberg turned to English and poetry. It was also at this time when he met Jack Kerouac, Lucien Carr, William S. Burroughs and Neal Cassady who would eventually form the \u2018Beat Generation\u2019. In 1948, Ginsberg had a vision of poet William Blake entering his apartment window, an event which would influence the rest of his life, attempting to recapture the image. In 1949, Ginsberg had a few minor run-ins with the law and he was committed to the Columbia-Presbyterian Psychiatric Institution. There he met his future publisher and life-long friend, Carl Solomon, a troubled intellectual. After serving in the merchant marines, and spending several months in Mexico, Ginsberg moved to San Francisco, where he met poets Kenneth Rexroth, Gary Snyder and Peter Orlovsky, who would become his life-long partner. After composing his first major notable poem, \u201cHowl\u201d, in 1955, he and Rexroth organized a reading of it at the Six Gallery, featuring Snyder and Michael McClure, with Lawrence Ferlenghetti (who later published the poem) and Kerouac in attendance. Ginsberg\u2019s first collection of poetry was published in 1956, but with its second printing in 1957, Howl and Other Poems (City Lights Books, 1956) was seized by U.S. Customs for being \u2018obscene\u2019. However, after a trial, the book was deemed to have literary merit, which propelled Ginsberg and the Beat group of poets into instant fame, giving Ginsberg the opportunity to promote Kerouac\u2019s On the Road and Burroughs\u2019 Naked Lunch. In 1956, Ginsberg received news that his mother had died, which compelled him to write the poems \u201cDeath to Van Gogh\u2019s Ear!\u201d and \u201cThe Lion for Real\u201d, and Kaddish and Other Poems (City Lights Books, 1961) as well as Empty Mirror: Early Poems (Corinth Books, 1961). During the 1960s Ginsberg traveled widely with Burroughs, Gregory Corso, Snyder to Paris, India, Tangier, Prague (where he was deported for being a corrupting influence). He published  Reality Sandwiches: 1953-1960 (City Lights Books, 1963), The Yage Letters with William Burroughs (City Lights Books, 1963), TV Baby Poems (Beach Books, 1968), Angkor Wat (Fulcrum Press, 1968), Planet News (City Lights Books, 1968), and Airplane Dreams: Compositions from Journals (City Lights Books, 1969). The years of 1968 and 1969 were filled with mourning for Ginsberg, as he learned of the death of both Neal Cassady and Jack Kerouac. The 1970s saw Ginsberg publish a number of collections, including The Fall of America: Poems of These States (City Lights, 1972), which won the National Book Award in 1974, The Gates of Wrath: Rhymed Poems, 1948-1952 (Grey Fox, 1972), Iron Horse (City Lights, 1974), First Blues: Rags, Ballads and Harmonium Songs, 1971-1974 (Full Court Press, 1975), Mind Breaths: Poems (City Lights, 1977), Poems All Over the Place: Mostly Seventies (Cherry Valley Editions, 1978). In 1976, Ginsberg and poet Anne Waldman were invited to create a writing program at the Naropa Institute in Colorado, which they named the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics. In the 1980s and 1990s, Ginsberg published Plutonian Ode and Other Poems, 1977-1980 (City Lights, 1982), White Shroud: Poems 1980-1985 (Harper & Row, 1986), Cosmopolitan Greetings: Poems, 1986-1992 (HarperCollins,1994), Selected Poems (HarperCollins, 1996), Death & Fame: Last Poems, 1993-1997 (HarperFlamingo, 1999). Until his death, Ginsberg used his fame and poetry to speak out against censorship, the Vietnam War and drug prohibition, and for gay rights. Allen Ginsberg died in New York City, on April 4th, 1997."

These are poems that will soon be published in a collection that I think it's going to be called The Grand Concourse, that some of you will know is the main street in the Bronx. When I find out what people think of the sight of the Grand Concourse who don't know that it's the main street in the Bronx, you know, they think I'm pretty pompous, but you know it's just another version of something like Flatbush Avenue or something like that. How they got this kind of name for the Bronx, I don't know. This is a poem called, by the way, I don't think I'm going to say too much in between these poems, I'm just going to read them, unless something happens that I will particularly want to say. \"Letter\".\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:01:39\nReads \"Letter\" [published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:04:17\nThis one is called \"A Bombadier's Landscape\".\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:04:28\nReads \"A Bombadier's Landscape\" [published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:05:54\nThis one is titled \"Called Home\" and it was the title of another collection of poems that I put together. \"Called Home\", I always liked this title, you know, and sort of found out later on what it meant, I always liked it, I wish I could have other titles that were sort of, that I liked as much.\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:06:27\nReads \"Called Home\" [published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:07:39\nReads \"Something\" [published later under a different title in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:08:06\nReads \"Lost Song\" [published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:09:04\nThis is a little poem called \"Davey\" for my son, Davey.\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:09:16\nReads \"Davey\" [published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:10:14\nThis is a poem I recently finished, it's called \"The Quiet\", and it's his reply to me. Because you understand that, all of this weight of seriousness, is supposed to lift the whole scene, which is what it's all about, you know, just lift the whole thing. Not to go down, you know, but to just lift it. So this is his, I never read this one before, but this is his response to me.\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:10:52\nReads \"The Quiet\" [published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far]. \n \nMilton Kessler\n00:12:08\nThis one is called \"I Am No One Else\", which is very important to me, you know, I'm sort of a, I have a kind of involuntary independence and sometimes I would like to try to imitate somebody else's life or lifestyle, or anything but it's just a hopeless case and I can't ever manage it. This is \"I Am No One Else\".\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:12:41\nReads \"I Am No One Else\" [published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:14:08\nI didn't read that too well, I really like that poem I don't want to mess it up, you know, but it's really very hard to be, to say a very, very tender kind of poem, because I'm not so tender, so I have a lot of trouble to be quiet, you know, because I can scream from here back to Brooklyn [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q18419] if I wanted to. This is the last of the poems in this particular part of the sequence. It's a little poem called \"Surprise\", I read it this afternoon. I've had the most amazing response sometimes, at places, when I go very often to the anti-war readings I read these poems, very often this one. And it always sort of surprises me you know, that it's alright. \"Surprise\". Let me tell you a little about this situation--but if I tell you too much about it then I'll read it, you know, I can talk more and it's a little poem. But it was after a big war-type reading at the Loeb Center in New York, and after that, everyone went out, you know, and roaming around all night, and then about 4 am or something like that I got on the subway and went out to my parents' place in Rockaway [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q62569], New York, on the ocean. And when I walked into the place, to their new house, I went to the--I walked in and saw that they were sleeping. And I had such a strong feeling, because when I was a kid, you know, and I used to come in late, either the door was locked, you know, the door was locked or there was this always this--come in after eleven, and you know, you won't get, you know, after eleven the door is locked, climb in through the fire escape or something. But here, you know, it was alright, and there it was and I stood and looked at them sleeping. They're both about 70. And by the way, extraordinarily happy. The poem is called \"Surprise\".\n\nMilton Kessler\n00:16:53\nReads \"Surprise\" [published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:18:05\nNow I have these three poems that I call the \u201cWillow Poems\u201d. One of them isn't finished, because the last two lines of the middle one are just, I got into a kind of pleasure in saying \"O\", you know, \u201cOh, Joy, Oh\u201d, and like that and sometimes I just enjoyed it so much I was just kind of, and then it didn't mean anything, it you know, I was just kind of enjoying it, which is great, you know, but it's great to enjoy it and also is maybe good, so you make them together like that, so here are the three \"Willow Songs\". This one, well here it is, it's perfectly clear.\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:18:58\nReads \"Willow Songs\" [part 1, published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:19:53\nIt's just like that beautiful girl, and you know, if you teach some place, what do you do? The last thing you do is hang around the school, stay away from it, you know, and so here I stay around the house, and here, I'm around the house during the day, you know, and so is this beautiful fifteen year old girl, and I'm watching her walk back and forth, you know, of course this is a song of innocence, you understand, this what she's got to worry about is me. Well I won't read the second one because the end of it isn't any good. But here is a little lyric, it's one of the Willow poems. I've written, it seems to me, an unusual number of poems that have something to do with my family. And whenever there's ever any suggestion of that kind coming from the world of important poetry, I really feel like just smashing somebody's head right in, nothing bothers me more than that, you know. The implication that something is important to you really isn't important, you know, just do what you please, that's all. But nevertheless, I do notice that there's a certain--sometimes I write a lot of these things. Here's a lyric. This is the last of them. It's a little poem.\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:21:38\nReads \"Willow Songs\" [part 3, published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:22:26\nNow this is a little different kind of series here. And this one is called, the first of these is called \"Summer's End\". This is a long poem that I wrote at a time, it's only some times that it's of any interest what these things develop out of, you know, but this one I think is kind of interesting. I had this very bad, I pulled a muscle in my calf, climbing a mountain, actually, in New Hampshire [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q759], where the mountains aren't too high, you know. And I was in a barn, I was at the MacDowell Colony [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3273867], and I was in a barn, and I couldn't get out, I couldn't move any place, I had one big jar, you know, next to the floor, sort of thing, and I just stayed there, and they would come around and bring me some food, finally about a week later I couldn't do anything and somebody--Hortense Calisher [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q436082]--I don't know if you know who she is, just finally came along and took my car, drove me to the airport, and that was that, kept the car. But while I was lying there, I said there's no big deal about it, but I have had asthma since I was seven, and the one thing about that, you know a little bit like Proust [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7199], if you just lie around, you just lie there and then you sort of, alright, so here you are. So you just do something I guess, so this poem, \"Summer's End\", there are a lot of things you do with these things lying around. I'll tell you--\"Summer's End\" alright, \"Summer's End\".\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:24:35\nReads \"Summer's End\" [published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:28:20\nLittle poem, \"Russian Joke\".\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:28:26\nReads \"Russian Joke\" [published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:29:02\n\"The Confusion: May 1969\". I\u2019ve never read this one before, nor is it finished, nor is it any good, as far as I can tell.\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:29:17\nReads \"The Confusion: May 1969\".\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:30:08\nThis one is called \"A Dream of Weeping\".\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:30:14\nReads \"A Dream of Weeping\" [published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:31:24\nHere's a brand new one, this is the last poem I've written, this one. We could stop for a few minutes, you know, if you're tired. I'm really terrified usually before this begins, but once it's going, you know, then it's alright, it's really very good. It's called \"The Moment of No Recovery\". Excuse me, \"The Moment of No Recovery\". Maybe the first one is better than this one. \"The Moment of No Recovery\", \"The Moment of No Discovery\", no this is better. It has only the slightest bit to do, by the way, with a woman in my family who I've recently come to know about, her name is Minnie, she is an aunt, she's my father's sister, she's been in the Rockland State Hospital [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q22061059] for over forty years. Only recently did I find out about her existence. And I remember when I talked to Allen  [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6711], oh a few months ago, and he said something, he was just talking about the kind of people who are locked up, and he said it's like mini, you know, like mini, and I said that's it! My aunt Minnie, I have this aunt, and he said, well, go, go and see her. You know, what's happening there, how many times she could have been alright, well of course, this is just a little bit to her maybe, but I think I may have been thinking about it a little. Other things too. \"The Moment of No Recovery\". I have to learn, I think, how to read this poem. \n \nMilton Kessler\n00:33:49\nReads \"The Moment of No Recovery\" [published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:35:10\nI've written quite a lot about women, and I have read so many of those, I know, but here is one that is a poem about--titled \"Anne\". When I read this poem in a Pittsburgh [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1342] high school, about three weeks ago, the teacher decided to call the whole thing off. After I read it, after I read it, and somebody asked me about why I read it and I said I read it because I liked it very much and because I--it was about women, you know, and it was kind of a poem of praise about women, and at that point this woman got up and called and said we have to move the chairs into another room, that's actually what she said, we have to take some of these chairs into another room now, sorry. What a bitch. The worst I've ever seen, she was just unbelievable. Let's not have any doubts about her, it was the Langley High School [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q15241542] in Pittsburgh. This poem is titled \"Anne\".\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:36:48\nReads \"Anne\" [published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:38:55\nThis poem is titled \"Chad Gadya: One Little Goat\"--a Chad Gadya is a passover song and I assume it's a round that has its sense, the idea that God makes it right. It has just the tiniest little autobiographical fact about it, which is that my grandfather actually sold papers in Brooklyn, so this is the beginning of the thing.\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:39:38\nReads \"Chad Gadya: One Little Goat\" [published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:41:4\nThis one is titled \"The Voice of the Soldier\", no one's saying anything about it.\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:42:00\nReads \"The Voice of the Soldier\" [published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:43:00\nThat's a song of innocence. I remember I showed this poem to a student of mine who was in the Israeli army [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q58967], and he immediately said \"No, it's not like that, that's not--it's not like that\" and he described how someone had had his leg blown off and what he said, he didn't say anything like this at all, he said to me, he said something else, and so of course I didn't mean that's the way I thought war was. This is the last one I'm going to read and it's one I haven't read. It's called \"A Good Death\", and it's a poem for Henry Thoreau [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q131149], it's \"A Good Death\" and it's for Henry Thoreau, and it's a century later. And it's the only time I tried, somebody just asked me, you know, it's to, to write something about Thoreau, which I thought would be absolutely impossible, but then as I started to read him, and I started to think of how I could never believe what he was saying, ever, like I could never believe so many affirmative, you know, things, and then I began to sort of see what--and I wrote this anyway. It was between Thoreau and me. You'll see what it sounds like.\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:44:51\nReads \"A Good Death\" [published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:45:20\n--oh damn it. That's the trouble, that's the way I am, you know, make the last one you're going to read, you know, something you don't know.\n \nEND\n00:45:33\n"

He completed a G.E.D. and married his high school sweetheart Sonia Berer in 1952. Kessler earned his undergraduate degree at University of Buffalo in English magna cum laude in 1957, and his master\u2019s degree at the University of Washington in 1962 and continued further study towards a Ph.D. at Harvard and Ohio State University until 1963. He won the Robert Frost Fellowship in poetry in 1961. Kessler taught at Queens College of the City University of New York from 1963 to 1965. His first published collection of poetry came out in 1963, named A Road Came Once (Ohio State University Press). He was awarded several Yaddo fellowships from 1965 to 1976, as well as MacDowell Foundation fellowships in 1966 and 1979. Kessler has taught English and creative writing at many universities throughout the world, including State University of New York, University of Negev (1971-1972), University of Hawaii (1975), Haifa University (1973), Keio University Tokyo (1978) and Antioch International Writing Seminars at Oxford (1977, 1978). His other collections of poetry are Called Home (The Black Bird Press, 1967), Woodlawn North (1970), and Sailing Too Far (1973). Kessler\u2019s poetry has been included in several anthologies, including Contemporary American Poetry (Penguin Books, 1972) and New York Times Book of Verse (Macmillan, 1970). The Grand Concourse: Poems (MSS State University of New York at Binghamton) was only published in 1990, decades after most of the poems were written. Milton Kessler died on April 17, 2000 in Binghamton, New York."

These are poems that will soon be published in a collection that I think it's going to be called The Grand Concourse, that some of you will know is the main street in the Bronx. When I find out what people think of the sight of the Grand Concourse who don't know that it's the main street in the Bronx, you know, they think I'm pretty pompous, but you know it's just another version of something like Flatbush Avenue or something like that. How they got this kind of name for the Bronx, I don't know. This is a poem called, by the way, I don't think I'm going to say too much in between these poems, I'm just going to read them, unless something happens that I will particularly want to say. \"Letter\".\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:01:39\nReads \"Letter\" [published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:04:17\nThis one is called \"A Bombadier's Landscape\".\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:04:28\nReads \"A Bombadier's Landscape\" [published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:05:54\nThis one is titled \"Called Home\" and it was the title of another collection of poems that I put together. \"Called Home\", I always liked this title, you know, and sort of found out later on what it meant, I always liked it, I wish I could have other titles that were sort of, that I liked as much.\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:06:27\nReads \"Called Home\" [published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:07:39\nReads \"Something\" [published later under a different title in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:08:06\nReads \"Lost Song\" [published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:09:04\nThis is a little poem called \"Davey\" for my son, Davey.\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:09:16\nReads \"Davey\" [published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:10:14\nThis is a poem I recently finished, it's called \"The Quiet\", and it's his reply to me. Because you understand that, all of this weight of seriousness, is supposed to lift the whole scene, which is what it's all about, you know, just lift the whole thing. Not to go down, you know, but to just lift it. So this is his, I never read this one before, but this is his response to me.\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:10:52\nReads \"The Quiet\" [published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far]. \n \nMilton Kessler\n00:12:08\nThis one is called \"I Am No One Else\", which is very important to me, you know, I'm sort of a, I have a kind of involuntary independence and sometimes I would like to try to imitate somebody else's life or lifestyle, or anything but it's just a hopeless case and I can't ever manage it. This is \"I Am No One Else\".\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:12:41\nReads \"I Am No One Else\" [published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:14:08\nI didn't read that too well, I really like that poem I don't want to mess it up, you know, but it's really very hard to be, to say a very, very tender kind of poem, because I'm not so tender, so I have a lot of trouble to be quiet, you know, because I can scream from here back to Brooklyn [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q18419] if I wanted to. This is the last of the poems in this particular part of the sequence. It's a little poem called \"Surprise\", I read it this afternoon. I've had the most amazing response sometimes, at places, when I go very often to the anti-war readings I read these poems, very often this one. And it always sort of surprises me you know, that it's alright. \"Surprise\". Let me tell you a little about this situation--but if I tell you too much about it then I'll read it, you know, I can talk more and it's a little poem. But it was after a big war-type reading at the Loeb Center in New York, and after that, everyone went out, you know, and roaming around all night, and then about 4 am or something like that I got on the subway and went out to my parents' place in Rockaway [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q62569], New York, on the ocean. And when I walked into the place, to their new house, I went to the--I walked in and saw that they were sleeping. And I had such a strong feeling, because when I was a kid, you know, and I used to come in late, either the door was locked, you know, the door was locked or there was this always this--come in after eleven, and you know, you won't get, you know, after eleven the door is locked, climb in through the fire escape or something. But here, you know, it was alright, and there it was and I stood and looked at them sleeping. They're both about 70. And by the way, extraordinarily happy. The poem is called \"Surprise\".\n\nMilton Kessler\n00:16:53\nReads \"Surprise\" [published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:18:05\nNow I have these three poems that I call the \u201cWillow Poems\u201d. One of them isn't finished, because the last two lines of the middle one are just, I got into a kind of pleasure in saying \"O\", you know, \u201cOh, Joy, Oh\u201d, and like that and sometimes I just enjoyed it so much I was just kind of, and then it didn't mean anything, it you know, I was just kind of enjoying it, which is great, you know, but it's great to enjoy it and also is maybe good, so you make them together like that, so here are the three \"Willow Songs\". This one, well here it is, it's perfectly clear.\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:18:58\nReads \"Willow Songs\" [part 1, published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:19:53\nIt's just like that beautiful girl, and you know, if you teach some place, what do you do? The last thing you do is hang around the school, stay away from it, you know, and so here I stay around the house, and here, I'm around the house during the day, you know, and so is this beautiful fifteen year old girl, and I'm watching her walk back and forth, you know, of course this is a song of innocence, you understand, this what she's got to worry about is me. Well I won't read the second one because the end of it isn't any good. But here is a little lyric, it's one of the Willow poems. I've written, it seems to me, an unusual number of poems that have something to do with my family. And whenever there's ever any suggestion of that kind coming from the world of important poetry, I really feel like just smashing somebody's head right in, nothing bothers me more than that, you know. The implication that something is important to you really isn't important, you know, just do what you please, that's all. But nevertheless, I do notice that there's a certain--sometimes I write a lot of these things. Here's a lyric. This is the last of them. It's a little poem.\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:21:38\nReads \"Willow Songs\" [part 3, published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:22:26\nNow this is a little different kind of series here. And this one is called, the first of these is called \"Summer's End\". This is a long poem that I wrote at a time, it's only some times that it's of any interest what these things develop out of, you know, but this one I think is kind of interesting. I had this very bad, I pulled a muscle in my calf, climbing a mountain, actually, in New Hampshire [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q759], where the mountains aren't too high, you know. And I was in a barn, I was at the MacDowell Colony [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3273867], and I was in a barn, and I couldn't get out, I couldn't move any place, I had one big jar, you know, next to the floor, sort of thing, and I just stayed there, and they would come around and bring me some food, finally about a week later I couldn't do anything and somebody--Hortense Calisher [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q436082]--I don't know if you know who she is, just finally came along and took my car, drove me to the airport, and that was that, kept the car. But while I was lying there, I said there's no big deal about it, but I have had asthma since I was seven, and the one thing about that, you know a little bit like Proust [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7199], if you just lie around, you just lie there and then you sort of, alright, so here you are. So you just do something I guess, so this poem, \"Summer's End\", there are a lot of things you do with these things lying around. I'll tell you--\"Summer's End\" alright, \"Summer's End\".\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:24:35\nReads \"Summer's End\" [published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:28:20\nLittle poem, \"Russian Joke\".\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:28:26\nReads \"Russian Joke\" [published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:29:02\n\"The Confusion: May 1969\". I\u2019ve never read this one before, nor is it finished, nor is it any good, as far as I can tell.\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:29:17\nReads \"The Confusion: May 1969\".\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:30:08\nThis one is called \"A Dream of Weeping\".\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:30:14\nReads \"A Dream of Weeping\" [published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:31:24\nHere's a brand new one, this is the last poem I've written, this one. We could stop for a few minutes, you know, if you're tired. I'm really terrified usually before this begins, but once it's going, you know, then it's alright, it's really very good. It's called \"The Moment of No Recovery\". Excuse me, \"The Moment of No Recovery\". Maybe the first one is better than this one. \"The Moment of No Recovery\", \"The Moment of No Discovery\", no this is better. It has only the slightest bit to do, by the way, with a woman in my family who I've recently come to know about, her name is Minnie, she is an aunt, she's my father's sister, she's been in the Rockland State Hospital [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q22061059] for over forty years. Only recently did I find out about her existence. And I remember when I talked to Allen  [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6711], oh a few months ago, and he said something, he was just talking about the kind of people who are locked up, and he said it's like mini, you know, like mini, and I said that's it! My aunt Minnie, I have this aunt, and he said, well, go, go and see her. You know, what's happening there, how many times she could have been alright, well of course, this is just a little bit to her maybe, but I think I may have been thinking about it a little. Other things too. \"The Moment of No Recovery\". I have to learn, I think, how to read this poem. \n \nMilton Kessler\n00:33:49\nReads \"The Moment of No Recovery\" [published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:35:10\nI've written quite a lot about women, and I have read so many of those, I know, but here is one that is a poem about--titled \"Anne\". When I read this poem in a Pittsburgh [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1342] high school, about three weeks ago, the teacher decided to call the whole thing off. After I read it, after I read it, and somebody asked me about why I read it and I said I read it because I liked it very much and because I--it was about women, you know, and it was kind of a poem of praise about women, and at that point this woman got up and called and said we have to move the chairs into another room, that's actually what she said, we have to take some of these chairs into another room now, sorry. What a bitch. The worst I've ever seen, she was just unbelievable. Let's not have any doubts about her, it was the Langley High School [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q15241542] in Pittsburgh. This poem is titled \"Anne\".\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:36:48\nReads \"Anne\" [published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:38:55\nThis poem is titled \"Chad Gadya: One Little Goat\"--a Chad Gadya is a passover song and I assume it's a round that has its sense, the idea that God makes it right. It has just the tiniest little autobiographical fact about it, which is that my grandfather actually sold papers in Brooklyn, so this is the beginning of the thing.\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:39:38\nReads \"Chad Gadya: One Little Goat\" [published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:41:4\nThis one is titled \"The Voice of the Soldier\", no one's saying anything about it.\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:42:00\nReads \"The Voice of the Soldier\" [published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:43:00\nThat's a song of innocence. I remember I showed this poem to a student of mine who was in the Israeli army [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q58967], and he immediately said \"No, it's not like that, that's not--it's not like that\" and he described how someone had had his leg blown off and what he said, he didn't say anything like this at all, he said to me, he said something else, and so of course I didn't mean that's the way I thought war was. This is the last one I'm going to read and it's one I haven't read. It's called \"A Good Death\", and it's a poem for Henry Thoreau [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q131149], it's \"A Good Death\" and it's for Henry Thoreau, and it's a century later. And it's the only time I tried, somebody just asked me, you know, it's to, to write something about Thoreau, which I thought would be absolutely impossible, but then as I started to read him, and I started to think of how I could never believe what he was saying, ever, like I could never believe so many affirmative, you know, things, and then I began to sort of see what--and I wrote this anyway. It was between Thoreau and me. You'll see what it sounds like.\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:44:51\nReads \"A Good Death\" [published later in Woodlawn North and Sailing Too Far].\n \nMilton Kessler\n00:45:20\n--oh damn it. That's the trouble, that's the way I am, you know, make the last one you're going to read, you know, something you don't know.\n \nEND\n00:45:33\n",

As you know from the propaganda sheets, we're presenting what I consider to be the centre of the Vancouver writing scene. Gladys Hindmarch has been in that scene for ten years, and was associated with all those people who've got all kinds of names over the last few years such as West Coast movement and the Tish movement and the New Wave Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16] and that sort of business. And Stan Persky [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2330087], was as much related if not more because he is also a sort of superstar of little magazines [audience laughter] in San Francisco [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q62], and made the usual move up to Vancouver, what, three years ago? And has now become the superstar of the Vancouver writing scene. What's going to happen is that the reading will be split into two pieces. At the beginning, Stan is going to introduce Gladys, and then there will be a break of about ten minutes, and then Gladys is going to introduce Stan. So, I'd like to give you \"Stan and Gladys Evening\".\n \nStan Persky\n00:01:43\n\"Beginning again and again is a natural thing, even when there is a series. Beginning again and again and again, explaining composition and time is a natural thing. It is understood by this time that everything's the same, except composition and time. Composition, and the time of the composition and the time in the composition. Everything is the same except composition and as the composition is different, and always going to be different, everything is not the same. Everything is not the same as the time when, of the composition, and the time in the composition is different. The composition is different, that is certain.\" Gertrude Stein [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q188385].\n \nGladys Hindmarch\n00:02:40\nWhen I whistle, just imagine that it's a very good whistler. \"They know what they're doing\".\n \nGladys Hindmarch\n00:02:53\nReads \"They know what they're doing\" [published later as \u201cCallback\u201d in The Watery Part of the World].\n \nGladys Hindmarch\n00:16:08\nThat's the third in a group of stories, or series of stories that I'm writing.

One time I was leaving shopping in the Army and Navy and a guy came down the hall and said, Look you know, they're trying to get a hold of you, you've gotta go up there. And I said, come on, now, and sort of walked me back to the hall. And one Christmas run there were fifty one men--lots of people don't want to go out at Christmas, but a lot of the seamen, just work in the summer, so if they can get a job for two weeks they take it. They had fifty one cards on the board and not one of them--and there was a call for a cook, which was a girl's job and a call for an able seaman, and not one of the fifty-one men would go out on the boat--they got a guy who hadn't registered yet went out.

However, she never published her own work in the magazine as she wrote prose. Her first publication was Sketches, published by George Bowering via the English Department of Sir George Williams University in 1970. Hindmarch wrote two novels, The Peter Stories (Coach House Press, 1976) and A Birth Account (New Star Books, 1967), which was followed by Watery part of the world (Douglas & McIntyre, 1988).

                "notes": "Writer, teacher, activist and critic Stan Persky was born in Chicago on January 19, 1941. Early on, he was influenced by the Beat Generation poets and decided he would pursue a career in letters. Persky enrolled in the US Navy, and then moved to San Francisco in the early 1960\u2019s where he became involved with the writers of the San Francisco Renaissance, including Jack Spicer, Robin Blaser and Robert Duncan. Persky\u2019s first publications include Les enfants du paradis (St-Denis Press, 1961) and Moss (Rabbit Mountain College, 1961). In 1966, Persky moved with Robin Blaser to Vancouver, where Persky received his BA and MA degrees from the University of British Columbia. Persky co-founded the Georgia Straight Writing Supplements in the late 60\u2019s, which led to what is now known as New Star Books. Persky and other writers began to publish the works of Milton Acorn, Gerry Gilbert, Jack Spicer, George Bowering, Fred Wah, bill bisset and Daphne Marlatt along with many others. Persky has taught at the Northwest College, Malaspina College, Simon Fraser University and at the Capilano University. Persky published Lives of the French Symbolist poets (White Rabbit Press, 1967),  The Day (Georgia Straight Writing Supplement, 1971), George Bowering published An oral literary history of Vancouver in 1972 in the Beaver Kosmos Series, Slaves (New Star Books, 1974), and Wrestling the angel (Talonbooks, 1976). His first political-themed books, Son of Socred (New Star, 1979), The House That Jack Built (New Star, 1980) and Bennett II (New Star, 1983) gained wide-spread acclaim. His other many publications include At the Lenin Shipyard: Poland and the Rise of the Solidarity Trade Union (New Star, 1981), The Solidarity Sourcebook (New Star, 1981), he edited Flaunting It: A Decade of Gay Journalism From the Body Politic with Henry Flam (New Star, 1982), The Holy Forest with introductions by Robin Blaser and Robert Creeley (Coach Hosue Press, 1998), Buddy\u2019s: Meditations on Desire (New Star Press, 1989) which won a Hubert Evans Non-Fiction Prize nomination, Then we Take Berlin: Stories from the Other Side of Europe (Knopf, 1995), On Kiddie Porn: Sexual Representation, Free Speech and the Robin Sharpe Case with John Dixon (New Star, 2001) and most recently Top Sentence: A Writer\u2019s Education (New Star, 2007). He has been a media commentator for the CBC, and has written for The Globe and Mail, the Vancouver Sun, Saturday Night, The Tyee and dooneyscafe.com as well as other journals. Persky resides in Vancouver and Berlin and continues to lecture and write."

As you know from the propaganda sheets, we're presenting what I consider to be the centre of the Vancouver writing scene. Gladys Hindmarch has been in that scene for ten years, and was associated with all those people who've got all kinds of names over the last few years such as West Coast movement and the Tish movement and the New Wave Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16] and that sort of business. And Stan Persky [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2330087], was as much related if not more because he is also a sort of superstar of little magazines [audience laughter] in San Francisco [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q62], and made the usual move up to Vancouver, what, three years ago? And has now become the superstar of the Vancouver writing scene. What's going to happen is that the reading will be split into two pieces. At the beginning, Stan is going to introduce Gladys, and then there will be a break of about ten minutes, and then Gladys is going to introduce Stan. So, I'd like to give you \"Stan and Gladys Evening\".\n \nStan Persky\n00:01:43\n\"Beginning again and again is a natural thing, even when there is a series. Beginning again and again and again, explaining composition and time is a natural thing. It is understood by this time that everything's the same, except composition and time. Composition, and the time of the composition and the time in the composition. Everything is the same except composition and as the composition is different, and always going to be different, everything is not the same. Everything is not the same as the time when, of the composition, and the time in the composition is different. The composition is different, that is certain.\" Gertrude Stein [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q188385].\n \nGladys Hindmarch\n00:02:40\nWhen I whistle, just imagine that it's a very good whistler. \"They know what they're doing\".\n \nGladys Hindmarch\n00:02:53\nReads \"They know what they're doing\" [published later as \u201cCallback\u201d in The Watery Part of the World].\n \nGladys Hindmarch\n00:16:08\nThat's the third in a group of stories, or series of stories that I'm writing. [Audience laughter]. I haven't got a title for this one, it's still in the first day on the trip but it's the seventh story. I call it \"The [Salad (?)] Story\" in my head but I'll have to find a title for it.\n \nGladys Hindmarch\n00:16:54\nReads [\"Nothing is Simple\", published later in The Watery Part of the World].\n \nGladys Hindmarch\n00:33:30\nAnother, I've got lots of others, but I'm just going to read one other short one that's got a number of daydream passages that I don't think I--it's necessary to know which of the day--I mean you can, I think you can get it, it's just call it \"Number 12\" right now it also hasn't got a title. \"Outside deck scene\"--I guess that George [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1239280] didn't say, I used to work as a mess girl and a cook on a West Coast freighter called the Tahsis Prince, I worked on four or five of them because I was relief working, but the main one I worked on went up the west coast of Vancouver Island [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q170479], and not, they have great difficulty getting women to go out there, maybe obvious reasons in these stories so I could almost get a job on it, whereas the other ones I could get jobs if nobody was available, but since on this particular boat, usually nobody was available. One time I was leaving shopping in the Army and Navy and a guy came down the hall and said, Look you know, they're trying to get a hold of you, you've gotta go up there. And I said, come on, now, and sort of walked me back to the hall. And one Christmas run there were fifty one men--lots of people don't want to go out at Christmas, but a lot of the seamen, just work in the summer, so if they can get a job for two weeks they take it. They had fifty one cards on the board and not one of them--and there was a call for a cook, which was a girl's job and a call for an able seaman, and not one of the fifty-one men would go out on the boat--they got a guy who hadn't registered yet went out. This is an end of summer trip, it's not rough at all.\n \nAnnotation\n00:35:42\nReads [\"How It Feels\u201d, published later in The Watery Part of the World].\n \nEND\n00:45:52\n[Cut off abruptly].",

What has really introduced Robert Creeley to me however, was something I heard him say back in 1963, to the effect that when a man begins to love himself, love himself, to be in the world as he is in it, then things begin to happen to him that are interesting. Now, this is a statement, which is enigmatic in its syntax and yet still spells out what I think you will find interesting about Robert Creeley tonight, that is that he's a man whose poems are close to the process of living. He will be able to give you information in his poems about this process. His poems are about someone who, no matter how difficult this process has become, has loved that particular moment of it. Now that Robert is supplied with cigarettes for the evening, he may as well begin.\n \nAudience\n00:01:43\nApplause [cut off].\n\nRobert Creeley\n00:01:48\nLet me. \"On Vacation\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:02:35\nReads \"On Vacation\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:02:55\nI'll read one more poem, I made it up all by myself, that's the only thing... \"Do You Think\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:03:03\nReads \"Do You Think...\" [published later in A Day Book].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:04:51\nIt's like a Latter Day [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q42504]quote, no it's like a--I've got a noun [unintelligible].\n\nAudience \n00:05:01\nLaughter. \n\nRobert Creeley\n00:05:03\nThis has nothing in the glasses, nothing in the glass, that's the problem. I want to read, frankly an old and dear friend Robin Blaser [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2115003], an old and dear friend, a man I much respect and care for just happens to be in the room, I haven't seen him since, like, almost, it feels like 20 minutes ago. But I want therefore to read a few poems that are more recent in composition. \"The Act of Love\".\n\nRobert Creeley\n00:05:50\nReads \"The Act of Love\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:07:55\nThen I'd like to read another poem because frankly Robin is a very particular friend, and not will know simply the information I'm trying to get clear, but will know the, you know, you like to read for people, shit, you know. \"The Birds\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:08:19\nReads \"The Birds\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:09:58\nThen that--\"things seem empty on vacation, if the labors have not been physical, then, some awful grating sound as if some monstrous nose were being blown...\" [begins to read \u201cOn Vacation\u201d]--no I've read that once, I won't read it again. But I wanted to read the most recent--I used to have, not an ambition, but I had a lovely sense of Allen Ginsberg's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6711] freedom in writing, happily, he's been here not too long ago. And I mean, Allen is a true contemporary, simply that we were born within say, what he's born--his birthday is June 3rd and mine's May 23rd of 1926 and we're, you know, we're very close in time and space. I used to have a sense of not Allen's permission in writing, I mean that permission doesn't exist. I mean, you write what you are given thus to write, nobody designs this occasion, nobody has the authority of it, and I did in a weird way, I envied Allen's ability to be where that situation might occur, you know. Like he could really write any moment, any place, anywhere, and so recently flying. In fact, last week, flying out to Los Angeles, not to Los Angeles, to San Francisco, I'd been awfully harassed in particular dilemmas of responsibility and suddenly sitting on the plane. There was this delicious space, you know, made peace with the plane by drinking everything they would give you instantly and having entered with some. I remember watching Warren, an old, dear friend get on a plane with like, four double vodkas. You know, I said \"Warren, you're going to get drunk\". He said, \u201cNo I'm flying back to Vancouver\u201d. Like you mistaked the occasion, you know. And so, I get on the plane, and I thought, \u201cwell I can do this too\u201d. And I wrote, my Bobbie who is a friend indeed of Robin's and myself. I'm literally her husband and Robin is a friend in that, what am I? I'm not going to propose that we're--no, but I think it's true. It has nothing to do with fucking. It has to do with the ambiance and reality of another human being. I think we share that reality in her. And she had gotten ill, unhappily and in some unexpected manner and then happily is now okay, but it was a crazy moment of dilemma. \"An Illness\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:12:52\nReads \"An Illness\". \n \nRobert Creeley\n00:15:55\nAnd I'm going to read a few more for Robin, and then, \"The Problem\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:16:06\nReads \"The Problem\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:16:44\nReads \"The Tiger\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:17:09\nWhat is reality--this is crossed out--[Reads excerpted material from \u201cThe Tiger\u201d]. \u201cWhat is reality we thought, who is here, we could smell the freshness of the jungle growth and would have been eaten by the tiger were it hungry\u201d [audience laughter]. It's all crossed out. I'll read, this is--\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:17:38\nReads unnamed poem.\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:18:33\n\"Not Being Dumb\"--this is, these are three things together.\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:18:36\nReads \"Not Being Dumb\u201d.\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:19:38\nReads [\"Harry\"].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:19:46\nLet me just, may I just read around, because these are, like, poems of like the last few months. This was a poem that is variously titled \"Sweet Dreams, Good Harbor Beach\". This is a place in Gloucester [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q49156]. It therefore has a physical location.\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:20:04\nReads \"Sweet Dreams, Good Harbor Beach\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:21:15\nI want to read one sequence of, a cluster of particular writing, I won't even have the arrogance to say these are necessarily poems. But the, because I don't in that sense, these are a sequence called \"In London\". And I had, I'll tell you, physically, the circumstance was that I was in London [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q84?wprov=srpw1_0] for five days last summer for a particular activity and I have happily a number of friends in London. Therefore, generously and, actually my time is really filled with seeing particular friends or else having particular business to conduct, and that's one, frankly, one of the satisfactions of one sense of what my life has to do with its own occasion, to have use and to have place. Not to say, \u201cGee, you're back again. We've kept the table. We've kept the seat for you\u201d. But to have an occasion that actually gives you place in the world is always a delight. And so therefore, I was there briefly and this particular morning, there was to have been a, actually, a recording and it turned out the circumstances of the recording hadn't worked out. So the people involved did not come and so there was a space of three hours in which I was staying at this friend's apartment in London on Wimpole Street, 76 Wimpole Street, just around Oxford Street. You know the neighborhood possibly. And it's a dazzling part of London for an American. Particularly, I mean, it's like Barrets and Wimpole Street and the whole bit, Paul McCartney [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2599?wprov=srpw1_0] had a place, like two blocks--did have a place two blocks--and the whole bit. You know, and it's very dazzling, and I was in this apartment and I was sleeping actually on the couch of this particular friend, and there were other beds available, but I did not manage. I was not aggressive, so therefore I slept on the couch. It was a heavy time for everybody, and I was thinking of Jim dying, you know whose \u201cA Retrospective of the Whitney\u201d has just opened. And I was staying, actually, with the wife of a publisher who happily I have in London, John Calder [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6224786] and Marion Boyars [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q18674153]. I was thinking of John Calder's apartment and John and his wife unhappily were having a, I mean, it's ridiculous, I'm not going to rehearse the whole situation of their lives, man. Like we've got enough to enter my own in that way, but the point is that I was sleeping on their couch, right? Everybody had left for their various activities and I was to meet these people to come in and set up this recording equipment and have this scene, and they didn't show up. And I had literally like two or three hours just in that apartment. I was padding around the place in my jammies, feeling beautifully luxurious and relaxed in London, you know, like digging out the window. I'd been the night previous reading at an International Festival of Poetry on a beautiful occasion, and I'd gone over. Jim Dine [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q531234] is frankly a friend from the States and I'd called him up, he's living in, where the hell does he live, Grosvenor square [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q932992], he's like in that district. He's living next to the Uruguay Embassy, like it's a very- he's running a house that somebody is trying to sell, but they can't find an appropriate buyer. Mick Jagger [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q128121] wanted to buy the house, but they didn't want a rock singer, and then the Nigerian Embassy wanted to buy the house but they didn't want to sell, you know. It was a whole trip. So Jim Dine has maintained the premises. So I go there and say \"Terrific\" and \"Wow\". We do the whole American bit, which is frankly to get over excited instantly, and to eat, drink, and be merry with an absolute insistence. And we're now driving over to make the Royal Festival Arts blah, blah, blah scene. And for an American it's a heady trip. I'm going to read now in company with the company of four other people, as part of the International Festival of Poetry and they're having this scene at a place, those of you who know London, they're having a scene at the Queen Elizabeth Hall [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1622428], that's part of the festival, you know like, complexes across the Thames [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q19686] from the Parliamentary buildings, Tower of London [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q62378], all that. So we're driving  through late London afternoon in July, delicious, I mean, the sun is fading in over those buildings the whole, oh wow, you know, just blow your mind. It's just fantastically tender and real, and that's where Raleigh [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q189144] was imprisoned in the Tower, and that's you know, fantastic. We arrive in absolutely pristine condition, and it took about two minutes to 'x' it all out. So the first two poems--it says \u201cFestival Hall London\u201d, like a note to myself on the side, and the first two poems--like the unrelieved tedium of the evening was just fantastic. I talked to a reporter of like a red rag, a socialist paper in London later. He said, \u201cI don't see any reason why you should show up, Mr. Creeley, before you're required, your presence is literally required\u201d. You know, so I said, \u201cDo you really think that's possible? Do you think I really could do that?\u201d. He said \u201cI don't see any reason why your condition and duty doesn't permit that kind of occasion\u201d, and I said \u201cThe hardest thing man is to sit there for like, it isn't the tedium of the people, it's the tedium of the occasion, it's like all these people. I have to have a rock in my pants that I thought it was hashish but it's actually three million, billion years old, it's a worm. We've got time, right?\u201d. So he said \u201cYou don't have to\u201d--what was your experience--he's trying to get some, you know he's trying to get some sense of the work as we're not permitted into the reading or something [audience laughter] and I quote the work as we're like generously absent from the reading, like you don't have to do that too, there's going to be a condition of that experience. \"In London\"\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:28:30\nReads \"In London\" [from In London]. \n\nRobert Creeley\n00:28:39\nThis was, like in this absolutely [unintelligible] environment you suddenly look around and see this exit, exit, exit sign red, exit, exit, exit, exit. There was a titter that ran through the audience and then there was nothing more. \"Cards\". This is now back in the apartment.\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:28:58\nResumes reading \"In London\" [from In London]. \n \nRobert Creeley\n00:30:03\nNow, I'll read the crossed out portions. \"There are people in the sky, now you see them, now you don't, won't you take me to my home, and let me play among the stars. The final fears of all the years are met in you tonight.\" This is, this flows out on vague rhythms. \u201c12:30\u201d written as Arabic numerals, read as 12:30 words.\n \nRobert Creeley \n00:30:30.\nResumes reading \"In London\u201d [from In London].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:30:36\n[Interrupts reading]. You know that scene when you're in a city and know one or two people, keep calling up, \"Well, Ted is sober\", [unintelligible] [audience laughter] and I said \"Man, I was there, I know how tired he is, I'm awake\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:30:50\nResumes reading \"In London\u201d [from In London].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:30:59\n[Interrupts reading]. This was a girl who played the lead in The Beard, actually, in the initial San Francisco [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q62] production who was now working in London playing the same part. Lovely young woman, Billy, trying to remember her last name, very soft and pleasant...\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:31:15\nResumes reading \"In London\u201d [from In London].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:31:20\n[Interrupts reading]. Let me interpolate, Chamberlain [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q468760] at one point had a weird erotic scene where they were making love by telephone. Have you ever tried that number? So John was was making things like sperm omelet, like he really, somehow it arrived in his madness of mid age, and decided that he was really going to go for broke in terms of sexual possibility. You ever see a man from Indiana take off on the possibilities of sexual endeavor? It's like- so John, Ultra Violet was the perfect foil for this condition. Ultra Violet [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q272994], if you've seen, you must have seen her on the Merv Griffin Show [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3404046], Ultra Violet like is like the most humorless, John had a tape of her singing \"The Fool on the Hill'' [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1920202] that went on for weeks. It was like years would pass by. \u201cZe fool on ze hill\u201d, you know. With this incredibly corny french accent. \"Ze fool on ze hill\" I remember, and he had a scene where they would make love like- I remember one time, the only, the first time I met- oh christ, I'm suddenly flipped out in my own mind, oh hell. It's ridiculous. Well, see, John had a studio on 13th Street and First Avenue, and Larry Rubens had a studio also, and a Japanese girl had a studio, and upstairs was like, directly over John's studio was, oh hell, who's the obvious sculpture, someone supply me with a name, it's ridiculous, the greatest imagination in the arts today in terms of this environment, [audience suggests name] Pardon? No, not Segal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q703624]. Like Oldenburg [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q156731], Claes Oldenburg. Claes Oldenburg lived upstairs and then he was still with his wife, his crazy factory, the industry, like making the ghosts, I mean they were making the mock-ups of the particular sculptures he was involved in and John, for example, would like wake up, you'd hear like- I spent nights in John's place and you'd hear the radio would turn on, in the morning, like to station k-whatever it was and then you'd hear them moving around getting breakfast and then hear the sewing machine start and the day would begin and Claes Oldenburg has a crazy serious humorous, like the peculiar to my- I was talking to someone about being, you know, coming from Nova Scotia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1952], or New Brunswick [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1965] or St. John's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2082] I mean like the [unintelligible] scene is very displaced by that Scandinavian economy, you know, of experience. So John was- do things like one night for an example, he and Ultra Violet had this thing going with the telephone and she called him and he happened to be out and she just let the phone ring. The phone rang from 11:00 to 7 in the morning [laughter.] Like it just keeps ringing. I remember I met Claes Oldenburg that morning, he said \"John, someone was trying to call you last night\" [laughter] and John says \"Yeah, I know.\" It was lovely, yeah. \u201cI got the message\u201d. And that was all either one of them said.\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:35:21\nResumes reading \"In London\u201d [from In London].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:37:41\n[Interrupts reading]. Then in the actual text there's a point that it's been in print actually for fifteen years in paperback. Somehow, nobody, the friends that we had didn't curiously notice. His reminiscences of Tolstoy [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7243] in London [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q84], for example. Have you ever read Gorky's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q12706] Reminiscences of Tolstoy? Fantastic book. \"Wish I were home\"...doesn't just turn you on informationally, it turns you on to conditions of experience, I hope.\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:38:08\nResumes reading \u201cIn London\u201d [from In London].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:39:30\nI wonder what this is, \"Aside, aside\", [unintelligible], February, Spring day, it's from California [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q99].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:39:46\nReads [\u201cThat Day\u201d from In London].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:39:51\n[Interrupts reading]. See, I love that \"And that day, in an oak tree, falls way, comes here\", I love that \u201cinterup-tions\u201d.\n\nRobert Creeley\n00:40:00\nResumes reading [\u201cThat  Day\u201d from In London].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:40:04\n[Interrupts reading]. I love that play of language.\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:40:07\nResumes reading [\u201cThat  Day\u201d from In London].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:40:54\nThat I, this was a--one time back in the earlier part of the 60's, Ginsberg [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6711] was given a tape recorder by Bob Dylan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q392] and when they were both in San Francisco [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q62]. Dylan gave Allen a Uher tape recorder and they had been in San Francisco, now Allen went down to Los Angeles [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q65] and he talked to people like Gerald Heard [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1606714], he had long conversations with Lenny Bruce [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q460876], and he also went to see Maria Huxley, and he was particularly interested as to what were Huxley's, not merely, he knew what Huxley died of, Huxley died of cancer in a factual and actual manner. But he was very interested into what was Huxley's not state, like he didn't want to hear his last words in some awful sense, but he wanted to know what kind of experience of death Huxley had had. And if this particular experience of death had been in any way informed by the circumstance of experience that Huxley had begun to be more and more involved with as he grew older, namely acid and the transformation, not the transformation but the particularization of experience that he found in the psychedelic so-called drugs. And so he asked Maria Huxley the very obvious question, \u201cwas Huxley on acid when he died? Did he take acid previous to his death?\u201d And she said, \u201cwell, he had asked that when he was thus conscious. I mean he did go into a coma. He did have a float, physically, and he asked that he have acid available. I mean that the cap of acid be place conveniently by the bed, and that he would obviously determine when and as and if he wanted to take it. It would be there. It would be like an aspirin, like a glass of water,\u201d and she said that roughly half an hour previous to his physical death, he took acid. And then Allen asked the other obvious question, did he say anything? Did he say anything of the experience of the circumstance? She said, no he didn't, he said nothing. But this is a woman who'd lived obviously with this man for a particular length of time and had information specifically, she said no, but there was this beatific smile, he was attending his own, you know, like he was attending, not the apocalypse, but the phenomenality of his own dispersion into you know other states of being, with the agency that's created.\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:43:49\nReads [section of \u201cLittle Time--And Place\u201d from In London]. \n \nRobert Creeley\n00:44:05\nI want to read one last poem from this text, and then I'll go back to books you may know. \"A Wall\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:44:15\nReads \"A Wall\".\n \nUnknown\n00:45:20\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of  time elapsed].\n\nRobert Creeley\n00:45:22\n..simply identifies the title of the book that you're referring to and the name of the man who wrote it. \n\nUnknown\n00:45:25\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n\nRobert Creeley\n00:45:26\n...he didn't want to make it hard for anybody, certainly didn't want to make it thus easy. But, particular information was always of that nature, you couldn't describe it, you certainly couldn't make it a convenience, so that the actuation of it for you always had to be the particular resource and fact of your own--I mean, it had to be that you did know it. It wasn't like one-upping, \"Gee, you don't know the name of the capital of Madagascar\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1019?wprov=srpw1_0], like I don't know the name of the capital of Madagascar, is there a capital of Madagascar? I guess, you couldn't. That wasn't the condition, but if something was there to be known, that was of some particular interest to him, he gave you the fact of that interest and the substance of that interest, but he didn't give you the convenience of that interest, you had not merely to track his experience into it, but you had to get there, like you had to get there by your own agency. But I think I could--someone said, like man, like the dots in this particular book, pieces, and there's a lovely remark by Ed Dorn [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5334756] whom I dearly love, he said you know, that sense of the pieces of the definition, [unintelligible] of the parts of some of the imagined whole, which these pieces are then the fragments or the parts of, then he says, he effectually suggests, think of a situation where the pieces do not compose that possible containment, the parts that do not necessarily relate and or have the substance of the whole thus to inform them. Like now, you're really in a hole, dig. And his definition of tradition: that which someone comes carrying the information of, literally, he got there, with the news. So the dots in this book, the three dots, those of you who are interested in these explications of text, these three dots simply indicate the intervals of a particular sitting, or a particular, you know literally, you see how this is written, it's like in a notebook, well what was written on a particular day would be separated in this text by three dots, you know, like usually the particular things written would be separated by one dot then when another day occurred there'd be three dots, I mean it's a very rudimentary division.\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:47:53\nReads \"The which it was\" [from Pieces].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:49:15\n\"Re Bob's Film (CUT)\", this was a movie done, friend--this is not even interesting, this is an 8 mm film called \"Cut\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:49:23\nReads \"Re Bob's Film (CUT)\" [from Pieces].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:51:53\nI want to skip, like I want to skip to the end of this book and read frankly, if I may for a close, let me read a sequence called \"Mazatlan: Sea\" which comes together as a close to this particular book and is writing of the same order.\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:52:15\nReads \"Mazatlan: Sea\" [from Pieces].\n \nEND\n01:07:47\n"

                "notes": "American poet and essayist Robert Creeley was born in 1926 in Arlington, Massachusetts. His early life was marred by tragedy, as he lost his left eye in an accident and suffered the death of his father when he was four years old. Creeley then grew up on a farm, and felt repressed by his traditional Puritanical New England upbringing. After a year of Harvard University, Creeley joined the US Field Service in India and Burma. Returning again to Harvard, he married his first wife Ann MacKinnon, with whom he had three children, only to leave Harvard in his final semester. From 1948 to 1950, Creeley and his family moved to several locations including Provincetown, New Hampshire; Provenance, France; and Mallorca, Spain. Once in Mallorca, he set up The Divers Press with poet Denise Levertov. Creeley thus began correspondence with Charles Olson, and Olson offered Creeley a teaching position at the Black Mountain College in North Carolina, as well as a Bachelor\u2019s degree in 1954. During his short time at Black Mountain, Creely edited Black Mountain Review, a journal known for its experimental writing. As well as many publications in poetry magazines, he published his first collection of short stories in The Gold Diggers in 1954 (Divers Press). After his marriage dissolved, Creeley headed West to San Francisco, meeting with Allen Ginsberg, Gary Snyder, and Kenneth Rexroth, as well as other Beat poets during the San Francisco Poetry Renaissance. Creeley then moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, completed his M.A., and then took a position as professor of English. There, he met and married Bobbie Louise Hall, with whom he had two daughters and for whom he wrote most of his love poetry. His first major collection of poetry was For Love: Poems 1950-1960, published in 1962 (Scribner Press). Creeley subsequently published his novel, The Island (Scribner Press, 1963), and other poetry collections including Words (Scribner), The Charm: Early and Uncollected Poems (Perishable Press, 1967), and Pieces (Scribner, 1969). His essays and prose publications include A Quick Graph: Collected Notes and Essays (Four Seasons Foundation, 1970), A Sense of Measure (Calder and Boyars, 1973), and Was That a Real Poem and Other Essays (Four Seasons Foundation, 1979). His marriage with Bobbie ended in the late 70\u2019s, and he married his third wife, Penelope Highton.  Creeley continued to publish his poetry in collections such as Later (New Directions, 1979), Mirrors (New Directions, 1983), Windows (New Directions, 1990), Echoes (New Directions, 1994), Life and Death (New Directions, 1998), and If I Were Writing This (New Directions, 2003). He has won a number of awards and honors, including the New York State Poet Laureate from 1989-91. He was elected a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets in 1999, received the Lannan Lifetime Achievement Award, the Bollingen Prize, the Shelley Memorial Award, a Rockefeller Grant and two Guggenheim Fellowships. Robert Creeley died in 2005, but his poetry has been published posthumously in On Earth: Last Poems and an Essay (University of California Press, 2009), The Collected Poems of Robert Creeley, 1975-2005 (University of California Press, 2006) and Robert Creeley: Selected Poems, 1945-2005 (University of California Press, 2008)."

                "contents": "Unknown\n00:00:00.00\n...thing which is regularly said when introducing Robert Creeley [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q918620] would be that he is a, a Black Mountain Poet [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2905420], and a colleague of Robert Duncan's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q57421163], and the late Charles Olson's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q922978]. What has really introduced Robert Creeley to me however, was something I heard him say back in 1963, to the effect that when a man begins to love himself, love himself, to be in the world as he is in it, then things begin to happen to him that are interesting. Now, this is a statement, which is enigmatic in its syntax and yet still spells out what I think you will find interesting about Robert Creeley tonight, that is that he's a man whose poems are close to the process of living. He will be able to give you information in his poems about this process. His poems are about someone who, no matter how difficult this process has become, has loved that particular moment of it. Now that Robert is supplied with cigarettes for the evening, he may as well begin.\n \nAudience\n00:01:43\nApplause [cut off].\n\nRobert Creeley\n00:01:48\nLet me. \"On Vacation\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:02:35\nReads \"On Vacation\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:02:55\nI'll read one more poem, I made it up all by myself, that's the only thing... \"Do You Think\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:03:03\nReads \"Do You Think...\" [published later in A Day Book].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:04:51\nIt's like a Latter Day [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q42504]quote, no it's like a--I've got a noun [unintelligible].\n\nAudience \n00:05:01\nLaughter. \n\nRobert Creeley\n00:05:03\nThis has nothing in the glasses, nothing in the glass, that's the problem. I want to read, frankly an old and dear friend Robin Blaser [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2115003], an old and dear friend, a man I much respect and care for just happens to be in the room, I haven't seen him since, like, almost, it feels like 20 minutes ago. But I want therefore to read a few poems that are more recent in composition. \"The Act of Love\".\n\nRobert Creeley\n00:05:50\nReads \"The Act of Love\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:07:55\nThen I'd like to read another poem because frankly Robin is a very particular friend, and not will know simply the information I'm trying to get clear, but will know the, you know, you like to read for people, shit, you know. \"The Birds\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:08:19\nReads \"The Birds\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:09:58\nThen that--\"things seem empty on vacation, if the labors have not been physical, then, some awful grating sound as if some monstrous nose were being blown...\" [begins to read \u201cOn Vacation\u201d]--no I've read that once, I won't read it again. But I wanted to read the most recent--I used to have, not an ambition, but I had a lovely sense of Allen Ginsberg's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6711] freedom in writing, happily, he's been here not too long ago. And I mean, Allen is a true contemporary, simply that we were born within say, what he's born--his birthday is June 3rd and mine's May 23rd of 1926 and we're, you know, we're very close in time and space. I used to have a sense of not Allen's permission in writing, I mean that permission doesn't exist. I mean, you write what you are given thus to write, nobody designs this occasion, nobody has the authority of it, and I did in a weird way, I envied Allen's ability to be where that situation might occur, you know. Like he could really write any moment, any place, anywhere, and so recently flying. In fact, last week, flying out to Los Angeles, not to Los Angeles, to San Francisco, I'd been awfully harassed in particular dilemmas of responsibility and suddenly sitting on the plane. There was this delicious space, you know, made peace with the plane by drinking everything they would give you instantly and having entered with some. I remember watching Warren, an old, dear friend get on a plane with like, four double vodkas. You know, I said \"Warren, you're going to get drunk\". He said, \u201cNo I'm flying back to Vancouver\u201d. Like you mistaked the occasion, you know. And so, I get on the plane, and I thought, \u201cwell I can do this too\u201d. And I wrote, my Bobbie who is a friend indeed of Robin's and myself. I'm literally her husband and Robin is a friend in that, what am I? I'm not going to propose that we're--no, but I think it's true. It has nothing to do with fucking. It has to do with the ambiance and reality of another human being. I think we share that reality in her. And she had gotten ill, unhappily and in some unexpected manner and then happily is now okay, but it was a crazy moment of dilemma. \"An Illness\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:12:52\nReads \"An Illness\". \n \nRobert Creeley\n00:15:55\nAnd I'm going to read a few more for Robin, and then, \"The Problem\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:16:06\nReads \"The Problem\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:16:44\nReads \"The Tiger\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:17:09\nWhat is reality--this is crossed out--[Reads excerpted material from \u201cThe Tiger\u201d]. \u201cWhat is reality we thought, who is here, we could smell the freshness of the jungle growth and would have been eaten by the tiger were it hungry\u201d [audience laughter]. It's all crossed out. I'll read, this is--\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:17:38\nReads unnamed poem.\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:18:33\n\"Not Being Dumb\"--this is, these are three things together.\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:18:36\nReads \"Not Being Dumb\u201d.\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:19:38\nReads [\"Harry\"].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:19:46\nLet me just, may I just read around, because these are, like, poems of like the last few months. This was a poem that is variously titled \"Sweet Dreams, Good Harbor Beach\". This is a place in Gloucester [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q49156]. It therefore has a physical location.\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:20:04\nReads \"Sweet Dreams, Good Harbor Beach\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:21:15\nI want to read one sequence of, a cluster of particular writing, I won't even have the arrogance to say these are necessarily poems. But the, because I don't in that sense, these are a sequence called \"In London\". And I had, I'll tell you, physically, the circumstance was that I was in London [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q84?wprov=srpw1_0] for five days last summer for a particular activity and I have happily a number of friends in London. Therefore, generously and, actually my time is really filled with seeing particular friends or else having particular business to conduct, and that's one, frankly, one of the satisfactions of one sense of what my life has to do with its own occasion, to have use and to have place. Not to say, \u201cGee, you're back again. We've kept the table. We've kept the seat for you\u201d. But to have an occasion that actually gives you place in the world is always a delight. And so therefore, I was there briefly and this particular morning, there was to have been a, actually, a recording and it turned out the circumstances of the recording hadn't worked out. So the people involved did not come and so there was a space of three hours in which I was staying at this friend's apartment in London on Wimpole Street, 76 Wimpole Street, just around Oxford Street. You know the neighborhood possibly. And it's a dazzling part of London for an American. Particularly, I mean, it's like Barrets and Wimpole Street and the whole bit, Paul McCartney [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2599?wprov=srpw1_0] had a place, like two blocks--did have a place two blocks--and the whole bit. You know, and it's very dazzling, and I was in this apartment and I was sleeping actually on the couch of this particular friend, and there were other beds available, but I did not manage. I was not aggressive, so therefore I slept on the couch. It was a heavy time for everybody, and I was thinking of Jim dying, you know whose \u201cA Retrospective of the Whitney\u201d has just opened. And I was staying, actually, with the wife of a publisher who happily I have in London, John Calder [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6224786] and Marion Boyars [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q18674153]. I was thinking of John Calder's apartment and John and his wife unhappily were having a, I mean, it's ridiculous, I'm not going to rehearse the whole situation of their lives, man. Like we've got enough to enter my own in that way, but the point is that I was sleeping on their couch, right? Everybody had left for their various activities and I was to meet these people to come in and set up this recording equipment and have this scene, and they didn't show up. And I had literally like two or three hours just in that apartment. I was padding around the place in my jammies, feeling beautifully luxurious and relaxed in London, you know, like digging out the window. I'd been the night previous reading at an International Festival of Poetry on a beautiful occasion, and I'd gone over. Jim Dine [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q531234] is frankly a friend from the States and I'd called him up, he's living in, where the hell does he live, Grosvenor square [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q932992], he's like in that district. He's living next to the Uruguay Embassy, like it's a very- he's running a house that somebody is trying to sell, but they can't find an appropriate buyer. Mick Jagger [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q128121] wanted to buy the house, but they didn't want a rock singer, and then the Nigerian Embassy wanted to buy the house but they didn't want to sell, you know. It was a whole trip. So Jim Dine has maintained the premises. So I go there and say \"Terrific\" and \"Wow\". We do the whole American bit, which is frankly to get over excited instantly, and to eat, drink, and be merry with an absolute insistence. And we're now driving over to make the Royal Festival Arts blah, blah, blah scene. And for an American it's a heady trip. I'm going to read now in company with the company of four other people, as part of the International Festival of Poetry and they're having this scene at a place, those of you who know London, they're having a scene at the Queen Elizabeth Hall [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1622428], that's part of the festival, you know like, complexes across the Thames [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q19686] from the Parliamentary buildings, Tower of London [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q62378], all that. So we're driving  through late London afternoon in July, delicious, I mean, the sun is fading in over those buildings the whole, oh wow, you know, just blow your mind. It's just fantastically tender and real, and that's where Raleigh [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q189144] was imprisoned in the Tower, and that's you know, fantastic. We arrive in absolutely pristine condition, and it took about two minutes to 'x' it all out. So the first two poems--it says \u201cFestival Hall London\u201d, like a note to myself on the side, and the first two poems--like the unrelieved tedium of the evening was just fantastic. I talked to a reporter of like a red rag, a socialist paper in London later. He said, \u201cI don't see any reason why you should show up, Mr. Creeley, before you're required, your presence is literally required\u201d. You know, so I said, \u201cDo you really think that's possible? Do you think I really could do that?\u201d. He said \u201cI don't see any reason why your condition and duty doesn't permit that kind of occasion\u201d, and I said \u201cThe hardest thing man is to sit there for like, it isn't the tedium of the people, it's the tedium of the occasion, it's like all these people. I have to have a rock in my pants that I thought it was hashish but it's actually three million, billion years old, it's a worm. We've got time, right?\u201d. So he said \u201cYou don't have to\u201d--what was your experience--he's trying to get some, you know he's trying to get some sense of the work as we're not permitted into the reading or something [audience laughter] and I quote the work as we're like generously absent from the reading, like you don't have to do that too, there's going to be a condition of that experience. \"In London\"\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:28:30\nReads \"In London\" [from In London]. \n\nRobert Creeley\n00:28:39\nThis was, like in this absolutely [unintelligible] environment you suddenly look around and see this exit, exit, exit sign red, exit, exit, exit, exit. There was a titter that ran through the audience and then there was nothing more. \"Cards\".

Let me interpolate, Chamberlain [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q468760] at one point had a weird erotic scene where they were making love by telephone. Have you ever tried that number? So John was was making things like sperm omelet, like he really, somehow it arrived in his madness of mid age, and decided that he was really going to go for broke in terms of sexual possibility. You ever see a man from Indiana take off on the possibilities of sexual endeavor? It's like- so John, Ultra Violet was the perfect foil for this condition. Ultra Violet [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q272994], if you've seen, you must have seen her on the Merv Griffin Show [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3404046], Ultra Violet like is like the most humorless, John had a tape of her singing \"The Fool on the Hill'' [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1920202] that went on for weeks. It was like years would pass by. \u201cZe fool on ze hill\u201d, you know. With this incredibly corny french accent. \"Ze fool on ze hill\" I remember, and he had a scene where they would make love like- I remember one time, the only, the first time I met- oh christ, I'm suddenly flipped out in my own mind, oh hell. It's ridiculous. Well, see, John had a studio on 13th Street and First Avenue, and Larry Rubens had a studio also, and a Japanese girl had a studio, and upstairs was like, directly over John's studio was, oh hell, who's the obvious sculpture, someone supply me with a name, it's ridiculous, the greatest imagination in the arts today in terms of this environment, [audience suggests name] Pardon? No, not Segal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q703624]. Like Oldenburg [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q156731], Claes Oldenburg. Claes Oldenburg lived upstairs and then he was still with his wife, his crazy factory, the industry, like making the ghosts, I mean they were making the mock-ups of the particular sculptures he was involved in and John, for example, would like wake up, you'd hear like- I spent nights in John's place and you'd hear the radio would turn on, in the morning, like to station k-whatever it was and then you'd hear them moving around getting breakfast and then hear the sewing machine start and the day would begin and Claes Oldenburg has a crazy serious humorous, like the peculiar to my- I was talking to someone about being, you know, coming from Nova Scotia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1952], or New Brunswick [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1965] or St. John's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2082] I mean like the [unintelligible] scene is very displaced by that Scandinavian economy, you know, of experience. So John was- do things like one night for an example, he and Ultra Violet had this thing going with the telephone and she called him and he happened to be out and she just let the phone ring. The phone rang from 11:00 to 7 in the morning [laughter.] Like it just keeps ringing. I remember I met Claes Oldenburg that morning, he said \"John, someone was trying to call you last night\" [laughter] and John says \"Yeah, I know.\" It was lovely, yeah. \u201cI got the message\u201d.

Dylan gave Allen a Uher tape recorder and they had been in San Francisco, now Allen went down to Los Angeles [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q65] and he talked to people like Gerald Heard [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1606714], he had long conversations with Lenny Bruce [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q460876], and he also went to see Maria Huxley, and he was particularly interested as to what were Huxley's, not merely, he knew what Huxley died of, Huxley died of cancer in a factual and actual manner. But he was very interested into what was Huxley's not state, like he didn't want to hear his last words in some awful sense, but he wanted to know what kind of experience of death Huxley had had. And if this particular experience of death had been in any way informed by the circumstance of experience that Huxley had begun to be more and more involved with as he grew older, namely acid and the transformation, not the transformation but the particularization of experience that he found in the psychedelic so-called drugs. And so he asked Maria Huxley the very obvious question, \u201cwas Huxley on acid when he died? Did he take acid previous to his death?\u201d And she said, \u201cwell, he had asked that when he was thus conscious. I mean he did go into a coma. He did have a float, physically, and he asked that he have acid available. I mean that the cap of acid be place conveniently by the bed, and that he would obviously determine when and as and if he wanted to take it. It would be there. It would be like an aspirin, like a glass of water,\u201d and she said that roughly half an hour previous to his physical death, he took acid. And then Allen asked the other obvious question, did he say anything? Did he say anything of the experience of the circumstance? She said, no he didn't, he said nothing. But this is a woman who'd lived obviously with this man for a particular length of time and had information specifically, she said no, but there was this beatific smile, he was attending his own, you know, like he was attending, not the apocalypse, but the phenomenality of his own dispersion into you know other states of being, with the agency that's created.\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:43:49\nReads [section of \u201cLittle Time--And Place\u201d from In London]. \n \nRobert Creeley\n00:44:05\nI want to read one last poem from this text, and then I'll go back to books you may know. \"A Wall\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:44:15\nReads \"A Wall\".\n \nUnknown\n00:45:20\n[Cut or edit made in tape.

Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n\nRobert Creeley\n00:45:26\n...he didn't want to make it hard for anybody, certainly didn't want to make it thus easy. But, particular information was always of that nature, you couldn't describe it, you certainly couldn't make it a convenience, so that the actuation of it for you always had to be the particular resource and fact of your own--I mean, it had to be that you did know it. It wasn't like one-upping, \"Gee, you don't know the name of the capital of Madagascar\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1019?wprov=srpw1_0], like I don't know the name of the capital of Madagascar, is there a capital of Madagascar? I guess, you couldn't. That wasn't the condition, but if something was there to be known, that was of some particular interest to him, he gave you the fact of that interest and the substance of that interest, but he didn't give you the convenience of that interest, you had not merely to track his experience into it, but you had to get there, like you had to get there by your own agency. But I think I could--someone said, like man, like the dots in this particular book, pieces, and there's a lovely remark by Ed Dorn [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5334756] whom I dearly love, he said you know, that sense of the pieces of the definition, [unintelligible] of the parts of some of the imagined whole, which these pieces are then the fragments or the parts of, then he says, he effectually suggests, think of a situation where the pieces do not compose that possible containment, the parts that do not necessarily relate and or have the substance of the whole thus to inform them. Like now, you're really in a hole, dig. And his definition of tradition: that which someone comes carrying the information of, literally, he got there, with the news. So the dots in this book, the three dots, those of you who are interested in these explications of text, these three dots simply indicate the intervals of a particular sitting, or a particular, you know literally, you see how this is written, it's like in a notebook, well what was written on a particular day would be separated in this text by three dots, you know, like usually the particular things written would be separated by one dot then when another day occurred there'd be three dots, I mean it's a very rudimentary division.\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:47:53\nReads \"The which it was\" [from Pieces].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:49:15\n\"Re Bob's Film (CUT)\", this was a movie done, friend--this is not even interesting, this is an 8 mm film called \"Cut\".\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:49:23\nReads \"Re Bob's Film (CUT)\" [from Pieces].\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:51:53\nI want to skip, like I want to skip to the end of this book and read frankly, if I may for a close, let me read a sequence called \"Mazatlan: Sea\" which comes together as a close to this particular book and is writing of the same order.\n \nRobert Creeley\n00:52:15\nReads \"Mazatlan: Sea\" [from Pieces].\n \nEND\n01:07:47\n",

            "contents": "diane_wakoski_i006-11-049.mp3\n\nIntroducer\n00:00:00\nOur poet this evening, Diane Wakoski [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1209000], by birth and education a Californian, has been a central figure on the New York [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60] scene, poetry scene, since 1961 or 62. She first came to attention outside New York City, with the publication of the small, but now somewhat legendary anthology Four Young Lady Poets. Since then, she has published nine volumes of poems, including Coins and Coffins, Discrepancies and Apparitions, The George Washington Poems, Inside the Blood Factory, Greed, and The Magellanic Clouds which I believe is to come out this year. I understand that some critics have tended to assign some of her recent work to so-called confessional school, which in her case means very little except that she writes about her own pictures of herself. Contrary to what one associates with the term confessional, Miss Wakoski writes a poetry that is syntactically direct and undeceiving. Yet, it is at the same time openly adventurous in its vocabulary, full of excitement and risk. It is thus a poetry that may perplex you, not because you do not understand it however, but because you do. And it's certainly one that you will enjoy hearing. Miss Wakoski, Diane!\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:01:45\nI wanted to know what that tower was doing, but it's locating the clouds.\n \nIntroducer\n00:01:56\nYeah, I believe there is a meteorological interest...\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:02:00\nWill you fall asleep if we don't have more lights on? I fall asleep in very dark rooms, I'm very loath to let the audience fall asleep, at least just for lights. If you can't hear me, I think there are more seats up here. This first poem I'm going to read is a poem that I wrote to a young poet a few years ago, I guess he's not so young anymore, but he was young when I wrote it, and he came to visit me in New York City to show me his poems, which were very nice poems, but he had been studying with Robert Creeley [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q918620], whom I very much admire, but who sort of has the kiss of death for any sensitive young man who studies with him, because they all come away looking like Robert Creeley, sounding like Robert Creeley and writing exactly like Robert Creeley. And I'm not exactly known for my tact, so when he asked me about his poems, I said I thought they were very nice Robert Creeley imitations. And he walked away in a huff, and I realized what a message that is constantly being communicated to women in our culture that even though we are asked to be able to think and act intelligently, when it really comes down to the nitty gritty, we are expected to compliment men and not to tell them what we really think. So I wrote him an apology. I'm not really apologizing for what I said, I'm apologizing for being a graceful enough woman in that situation. And this poem, I think, says very much what I would like to say to all of you who wrote poetry who are young, or who do anything else. \"An Apology\".\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:04:20\nReads \"An Apology\" [from Inside The Blood Factory].\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:06:15\nI don't really believe that, as I say. But I do believe in the necessity of having to say it. This next poem I'd like to read is a poem in which, again, I ask a kind of rhetorical question that is a very meaningful one for all women in our culture. I think, by the way, that in spite of the fact that I constantly talk about what problems women do have in a contemporary society that at last has freed them from the burden of constant babysitting and washing and ironing and so forth, that the whole mix up of what roles are about makes the life of a woman very hard, but I think that really, it's probably a man's role, it's harder to play the woman and my experience has been most of the time when women are punished in our society or have real problems with being women it's because they are getting the feedback from how complicated and impossible the demands on men have been and the men are feeding it back to them and if maybe we could ever solve that real dilemma of what the complete man is allowed to be, then women wouldn't suffer. I don't really think that anything women can do will do any good until the man's world is a more possible one to live in. At any rate, this poem asks a question that I constantly ask, why is it when a woman who shows strength, strength is something that we should all be honoured for having and being able to live with in our life, why should a woman be punished for her strength? As strong women often are. It's called \"Slicing Oranges for Jeremiah\".\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:08:19\nReads \"Slicing Oranges for Jeremiah\" [from Inside The Blood Factory].\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:12:58\nI'm very interested in, well, actually, something that all poets are involved in, and that is trying to use the mythology of their culture to somehow be able to talk about their own personal realities and still be able to communicate with other people in terms of kind of common cultural experience. And I've been writing a series of poems that I call the \"George Washington [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q23] Poems\" to help me do this and every once in a while I will pick up on other things also and something that's always fascinated me, being from California [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q99], are the legends of the Wild West [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q190267] and the way people still sort of look at Americans as pioneers and cowboys and in a way how we like to flatter ourselves, all of us that we have a certain kind of ruggedness because of this pioneer tradition. But one of the confusions that has grown up out of that cultural image is again, something that concerns me very much, as women, we've all been brainwashed to fall in love with men who have this very rugged image who are able to do tough rugged things, and unfortunately, reality doesn't always live up to those images that are presented to us so we're falling madly in love with these men who turn out to often not like women, because that whole western life was geared for men, and not for women. So in this poem I'm lodging my protest officially. It's called \"Follow that Stagecoach\".\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:14:55\nReads \"Follow that Stagecoach\" [from Discrepancies and Apparitions].\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:19:57\nDo you think you need the mic in the back? What do you think? I'm going to move up? ...Is this an amplifying mic? ....Can you hear me now any better back there? I'm going to read a few \"George Washington\" poems. Are you getting clicky sound? Maybe if I turn it away, it'll amplify...This poem is called \"Patriotic Poem\" and I always dedicate it to J.

This is in hopes that someday I'll be considered a great American Patriot.\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:21:53\nReads \"Patriotic Poem\" [from The George Washington Poems].\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:25:09\nThe next poem is called \"George Washington Writes Home about Harvesting his Hemp\".

So, it was really a very great shock to see him appear on stage with his lumber boots, his blue jeans, his work shirt, his tweed jacket with a leather patch and a ring on his little finger. So I went home and wrote this poem. It's called \"Ringless\".\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:32:17\nReads \"Ringless\" [from Inside The Blood Factory].\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:35:41\nAnother one of my heroes is Beethoven [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q255], this is Beethoven's two-hundred centennial by the way. I like Beethoven for a lot of reasons, but I suppose why I pick on him to talk about is that Beethoven stands for the ability to use anger and make it into something very beautiful and powerful. Again, we live in a culture that makes life very difficult for us and one of the things we're taught as children is that to express anger is a bad thing, not that it's a natural, healthy thing and that in fact until the anger is expressed, the love can't exist. So I'm going to read this poem which is called \"In Gratitude to Beethoven\".\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:36:49\nReads \"In Gratitude to Beethoven\" [from Inside The Blood Factory].\n\nUnknown\n00:41:58\n[Cut or edit in tape].\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:42:01\nResumes reading of \u201cIn Gratitude to Beethoven\u201d.\n \nUnknown\n00:43:08\n[Cut or edit in tape].\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:43:10\n...poets in the world I assume. I wrote a poem about landing on the moon. The moon traditionally is poet's subject and I suppose I feel even more involved, since my name is Diane and I've always felt that either the moon belonged to me, or that I was the moon, so having it landed on gave me a lot of complicated feelings. And I wrote this poem called \"The Ten Dollar Cab Ride\", which is dedicated to Robert Duncan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q964391], because he once told this story, some of you must know this, I don't think he wrote it in any of his poems, I once heard him tell the story but it could easily be in one of his poems. It was about a number of years ago when he was much, much younger and his life was much more difficult than it is right now and I guess one of his problems was money and money tends to get people very depressed at times, and he was depressed about everything else and he also didn't have any money so he decided he was going to kill himself, and he didn't really want to do it right that minute. But he wanted to do it, and all he had was ten dollars and so he decided he would take a cab ride and when the ten dollars was up, he'd get out and kill himself. But he made the fatal mistake, or I should say the life-giving mistake, of going for a cab ride in Golden Gate Park [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q635559] in San Francisco [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q62] which is very, very beautiful and by the end of his ten dollars, he felt so good that he had to get out and walk home. I always thought that was a hopeful story for any of us. Anyway, \"The Ten Dollar Cab Ride\" for Robert Duncan.\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:45:06\nReads \"The Ten Dollar Cab Ride\".\n \nUnknown\n00:47:22\n[Cut or edit in tape].\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:47:43\nResumes reading \u201cThe Ten Dollar Cab Ride\u201d.\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:50:15\nI'm going to read one last poem which is the title poem of a book, it's called the \"Magellanic Clouds\".

                "contents": "Introducer\n00:00:00\nOur poet this evening, Diane Wakoski [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1209000], by birth and education a Californian, has been a central figure on the New York [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60] scene, poetry scene, since 1961 or 62. She first came to attention outside New York City, with the publication of the small, but now somewhat legendary anthology Four Young Lady Poets. Since then, she has published nine volumes of poems, including Coins and Coffins, Discrepancies and Apparitions, The George Washington Poems, Inside the Blood Factory, Greed, and The Magellanic Clouds which I believe is to come out this year. I understand that some critics have tended to assign some of her recent work to so-called confessional school, which in her case means very little except that she writes about her own pictures of herself. Contrary to what one associates with the term confessional, Miss Wakoski writes a poetry that is syntactically direct and undeceiving. Yet, it is at the same time openly adventurous in its vocabulary, full of excitement and risk. It is thus a poetry that may perplex you, not because you do not understand it however, but because you do. And it's certainly one that you will enjoy hearing. Miss Wakoski, Diane!\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:01:45\nI wanted to know what that tower was doing, but it's locating the clouds.\n \nIntroducer\n00:01:56\nYeah, I believe there is a meteorological interest...\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:02:00\nWill you fall asleep if we don't have more lights on? I fall asleep in very dark rooms, I'm very loath to let the audience fall asleep, at least just for lights. If you can't hear me, I think there are more seats up here. This first poem I'm going to read is a poem that I wrote to a young poet a few years ago, I guess he's not so young anymore, but he was young when I wrote it, and he came to visit me in New York City to show me his poems, which were very nice poems, but he had been studying with Robert Creeley [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q918620], whom I very much admire, but who sort of has the kiss of death for any sensitive young man who studies with him, because they all come away looking like Robert Creeley, sounding like Robert Creeley and writing exactly like Robert Creeley. And I'm not exactly known for my tact, so when he asked me about his poems, I said I thought they were very nice Robert Creeley imitations. And he walked away in a huff, and I realized what a message that is constantly being communicated to women in our culture that even though we are asked to be able to think and act intelligently, when it really comes down to the nitty gritty, we are expected to compliment men and not to tell them what we really think. So I wrote him an apology. I'm not really apologizing for what I said, I'm apologizing for being a graceful enough woman in that situation. And this poem, I think, says very much what I would like to say to all of you who wrote poetry who are young, or who do anything else. \"An Apology\".\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:04:20\nReads \"An Apology\" [from Inside The Blood Factory].\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:06:15\nI don't really believe that, as I say. But I do believe in the necessity of having to say it. This next poem I'd like to read is a poem in which, again, I ask a kind of rhetorical question that is a very meaningful one for all women in our culture. I think, by the way, that in spite of the fact that I constantly talk about what problems women do have in a contemporary society that at last has freed them from the burden of constant babysitting and washing and ironing and so forth, that the whole mix up of what roles are about makes the life of a woman very hard, but I think that really, it's probably a man's role, it's harder to play the woman and my experience has been most of the time when women are punished in our society or have real problems with being women it's because they are getting the feedback from how complicated and impossible the demands on men have been and the men are feeding it back to them and if maybe we could ever solve that real dilemma of what the complete man is allowed to be, then women wouldn't suffer. I don't really think that anything women can do will do any good until the man's world is a more possible one to live in. At any rate, this poem asks a question that I constantly ask, why is it when a woman who shows strength, strength is something that we should all be honoured for having and being able to live with in our life, why should a woman be punished for her strength? As strong women often are. It's called \"Slicing Oranges for Jeremiah\".\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:08:19\nReads \"Slicing Oranges for Jeremiah\" [from Inside The Blood Factory].\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:12:58\nI'm very interested in, well, actually, something that all poets are involved in, and that is trying to use the mythology of their culture to somehow be able to talk about their own personal realities and still be able to communicate with other people in terms of kind of common cultural experience. And I've been writing a series of poems that I call the \"George Washington [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q23] Poems\" to help me do this and every once in a while I will pick up on other things also and something that's always fascinated me, being from California [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q99], are the legends of the Wild West [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q190267] and the way people still sort of look at Americans as pioneers and cowboys and in a way how we like to flatter ourselves, all of us that we have a certain kind of ruggedness because of this pioneer tradition.

This is in hopes that someday I'll be considered a great American Patriot.\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:21:53\nReads \"Patriotic Poem\" [from The George Washington Poems].\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:25:09\nThe next poem is called \"George Washington Writes Home about Harvesting his Hemp\".

So, it was really a very great shock to see him appear on stage with his lumber boots, his blue jeans, his work shirt, his tweed jacket with a leather patch and a ring on his little finger. So I went home and wrote this poem. It's called \"Ringless\".\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:32:17\nReads \"Ringless\" [from Inside The Blood Factory].\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:35:41\nAnother one of my heroes is Beethoven [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q255], this is Beethoven's two-hundred centennial by the way. I like Beethoven for a lot of reasons, but I suppose why I pick on him to talk about is that Beethoven stands for the ability to use anger and make it into something very beautiful and powerful. Again, we live in a culture that makes life very difficult for us and one of the things we're taught as children is that to express anger is a bad thing, not that it's a natural, healthy thing and that in fact until the anger is expressed, the love can't exist. So I'm going to read this poem which is called \"In Gratitude to Beethoven\".\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:36:49\nReads \"In Gratitude to Beethoven\" [from Inside The Blood Factory].\n\nUnknown\n00:41:58\n[Cut or edit in tape].\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:42:01\nResumes reading of \u201cIn Gratitude to Beethoven\u201d.\n \nUnknown\n00:43:08\n[Cut or edit in tape].\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:43:10\n...poets in the world I assume. I wrote a poem about landing on the moon. The moon traditionally is poet's subject and I suppose I feel even more involved, since my name is Diane and I've always felt that either the moon belonged to me, or that I was the moon, so having it landed on gave me a lot of complicated feelings. And I wrote this poem called \"The Ten Dollar Cab Ride\", which is dedicated to Robert Duncan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q964391], because he once told this story, some of you must know this, I don't think he wrote it in any of his poems, I once heard him tell the story but it could easily be in one of his poems. It was about a number of years ago when he was much, much younger and his life was much more difficult than it is right now and I guess one of his problems was money and money tends to get people very depressed at times, and he was depressed about everything else and he also didn't have any money so he decided he was going to kill himself, and he didn't really want to do it right that minute. But he wanted to do it, and all he had was ten dollars and so he decided he would take a cab ride and when the ten dollars was up, he'd get out and kill himself. But he made the fatal mistake, or I should say the life-giving mistake, of going for a cab ride in Golden Gate Park [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q635559] in San Francisco [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q62] which is very, very beautiful and by the end of his ten dollars, he felt so good that he had to get out and walk home. I always thought that was a hopeful story for any of us. Anyway, \"The Ten Dollar Cab Ride\" for Robert Duncan.\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:45:06\nReads \"The Ten Dollar Cab Ride\".\n \nUnknown\n00:47:22\n[Cut or edit in tape].\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:47:43\nResumes reading \u201cThe Ten Dollar Cab Ride\u201d.\n \nDiane Wakoski\n00:50:15\nI'm going to read one last poem which is the title poem of a book, it's called the \"Magellanic Clouds\".

My own feeling about reading poetry is that the poem is exposed to the audience at a much faster rate than what the poem is when it's on the page, and excuse me, I'm going to give you a fair bit of background material on some of these poems. These are a collection of prose poems.\n \nFrank Davey\n00:01:20\nReads unnamed poem.\n \nFrank Davey\n00:02:13\nReads \u201cCounting\u201d [from Weeds].\n\nFrank Davey\n00:03:11\nReads \"The Bandit\" [from Weeds]. \n \nFrank Davey\n00:04:08\nTo me some of these poems are remarkable because at the time I didn't know this marriage was breaking up and some of the, some of the poems as you can see are about experiences other than marriage and suddenly I realize of course as these poems were progressing, in particular toward the end, that the message was certainly that there was something rather infertile in my whole life, I mean even in the next poem I'm going to read, I didn't catch on, I thought, 'oh well, I'll write this poem, I can't really show it to my wife, but you know, so what'.\n \nFrank Davey\n00:04:44\nReads \"Mealtimes\" [from Weeds].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:05:46\nReads \"The Place\" [from Weeds].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:06:39\nThese poems actually form a sequence, I'm only giving you certain examples of them and jumping ahead and now the cat is suddenly in the next poem as if it hadn't left.\n \nFrank Davey\n00:06:52\nReads \"The Calling\" [from Weeds].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:08:08\nWell by this point in the sequence, the message was beginning to become more available to me. I was, I admit beginning to understand what I was writing by this point. I've always felt that it's important to write a poem whether or not you realize its significance or its relevance to your own life that you go ahead and write the poem anyway. And in this particular sequence, my own faith that poetry can reveal things to you, that the process of writing poems is a process of discovery, that in fact poems teach the poet, rather than the poet teaching the poems. The poems are wiser than the poet, if you want to look at it that way. This was--seemed to be borne out. \n\nFrank Davey\n00:09:15\nReads \"Leaves\" [from Weeds].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:10:25\nReads \"A Letter\" [from Weeds].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:11:35\nReads \"Them Apples\" [from Weeds].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:12:39\nReads \"I Do Not Write Poems\" [from Weeds].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:13:40\nReads \"Red\" [from Weeds].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:14:41\nMany ways experience played into the hands of the poems, very nice that the most disastrous years of that marriage happened to begin in a summertime situation, and to end in winter, so that the seasonal, the cycle of the seasons could play its part in the poem. But on the other hand, perhaps that wasn't accidental. One doesn't want to question these things after they've worked for you.

We think of the problems of the defoliant in South Vietnam, when what they estimate now that more than 10% of the country has been treated with defoliant. We don't think of the individual examples of the flora and fauna which may be threatened with extinction because of this defoliation. Man of course is only one of the many inhabitants of this planet and although it is certainly a despicable thing that the biological function of human beings have been interfered with by the defoliation, children are being born malnourished, these are not the only sufferers. \n \nFrank Davey\n00:21:58\nReads \"The Drongo\" [from Four Myths for Sam Perry].\n \nUnknown\n00:23:27\n[Cut or edit made in tape.

I've been somewhat disappointed to learn that all kinds of other poets have been doing this at the same time. They're getting their stuff into print but I haven't bothered because I was going to do all 88 cards and publish them all at once.

For lack of a better descriptive term, I might call myself an anti-humanist, this is of course the--it's almost become a category, I thought it was unique at one point, but it's become of late a category. I think more and more people are realizing that man is not capable of appointing himself as manager, or he's capable of appointing himself, he's not capable of acting out his self-appointment as manager of this planet. That in fact, his capabilities at managing certain areas create problems that are multiples of the ones he has solved. And that the humanist dream of man through his own rationality creating a nearly utopian existence, coming to understand the workings of the universe in such a way that he can bend them to his own use, but this dream has not going to come true. And of course, one of the ways that this feeling in men has been manifested has been his utilization of light and energy, and well, to the poem. \"A Light Poem\".\n \nFrank Davey\n00:32:25\nReads \"A Light Poem\" [from Four Myths for Sam Perry]..\n \nUnknown\n00:37:24\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n\nFrank Davey\n00:37:25\nRecently I have been writing poems from tarot cards. I have noticed a couple of things about the tarot cards that are very important for the poems. One of these is that the female symbol seems to be the most important symbol in the deck and it seems to suggest that the universe itself is essentially feminine in nature, that the fertility of the universe is feminine. Another aspect of the cards suggests that the nature of the universe is such that all sorts of mysterious things can happen to it without our understanding them. That there are all sorts of forces indicated in these cards that are essentially outside of our control. This poem, entitled \"To Win at Cards\". Tarot cards are not cards whose primary purpose is to play a game. The decks of cards with which we are all familiar with are cards where you play a game, the object of course of playing cards is to win at cards. And winning of course, is something which we are all brought up to wish, so one of the things about our competitive society that makes it work is that we all want to win. And card games help indoctrinate us in this direction. Cards, can also tell you things, this is the thing that the tarot cards have in common with poetry, is that people don't win in poetry, you don't write a better poem than somebody else in order to win prizes or to--you don't use poems in order to seduce a girl, or you don't use poems in order to accomplish any kind of end outside of the end of writing the poem. If you do, your allegiance is not to the poem and it's to something else and you're prostituting the poem. The only thing which can win at poetry is the poem itself, and this is where the poet ought to apply his effort to, is to helping the poem win.\n \nFrank Davey\n00:40:15\nReads \"To Win at Cards\" published later in Arcana].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:41:20\nThis poem, entitled \"The Hermit\", one of the figures on the cards. The card happened to cause me to recall a childhood memory of an earthquake.\n \nFrank Davey\n00:41:35\nReads \"The Hermit\" [published later in Arcana].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:42:49\nIt became very clear to me writing these Tarot poems that indeed there were many things outside of one's control and my wife and I were putting together a jigsaw puzzle of the moon, I think it was a satellite photograph of one side of the moon, and things started to go wrong.\n \nFrank Davey\n00:43:16\nReads [\u201cLuna\u201d, published later in Arcana].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:44:52\nThroughout history of course, men have been obsessed with the idea of being displaced by another man. Either in the seat--in the kingdom, or in the favors of the special woman in their lives. We have in mythology of course, many myths of Gods being displaced very often by their children. In Greek drama of course, the classical example is the Oedipus [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q130890] myth where Laius [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q463898] and Jocasta [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q131445] have their married lives disrupted by their son, Oedipus. This is a poem about this particular fear. Fear of being displaced by someone younger, very often, fear of being displaced by one's own son, although that's not necessarily integral to the poem.\n \nFrank Davey\n00:45:53\nReads [\"Menelaus, To You\", published later in Arcana].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:47:19\nIf you choose to go to war with the natural environment, strange things happen. \u201cKing of Pentacles\u201d is wrapped in a coat of binds.\n \nFrank Davey\n00:47:34\nReads \"King of Pentacles\" [published later in Arcana].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:48:44\nTimes when men do the right things, or seem to do the right things. A poem called \"The Caughnawaga Bell\".\n \nFrank Davey\n00:48:55\nReads \"The Caughnawaga Bell\" [published later in Arcana].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:50:32\nI'd like to conclude with a couple of poems about the whole problem of writing. It's always a problem for a poet to keep the process of writing going. One of the tricks of poets of course is always to write poems about the fact that the process of writing isn't going. I have a number of these. \"The Mountain\".\n \nFrank Davey\n00:51:06\nReads \"The Mountain\" [from Four Myths for Sam Perry].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:51:50\nOf course, the thing is, as soon as you begin to pay homage to the fact that you're having trouble writing a poem and express your will to, you are in fact being repaid. As soon as I remembered this myth of Popocatepetl [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1782392] and you know, the earth literally repaying the boy for his homage representing him with a mountain. If you couldn't grow corn on it, at least you could lure the Yankees down to look at. [Audience laughter].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:52:24\nReads \"The Bells\" [from Four Myths for Sam Perry].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:53:33\nThis poem, entitled \"The Making\".\n \nFrank Davey\n00:53:41\nReads \"The Making\" [from Four Myths for Sam Perry].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:55:34\nAnd so, I wish you all good winds!\n \nEND\n00:55:37\n"

He received his B.A. and M.A. from the University of British Columbia, where he co-founded and edited the influential Tish magazine from 1961-1969. Davey\u2019s first book of poetry was published in 1963, called D-Day and after (Tishbooks), which was followed by Bridge force (Contact Press, 1965) and The scarred hull (Imago, 1966). Davey founded Open Letter, a journal of avant-garde writing and theory(which is still being published) in 1965. He then completed a Ph.D. in 1968 at the University of Southern California, with a thesis on the Black Mountain poetics. His poems from this period were collected and published in 1972 in L\u2019an trentiesme: selected poems 1961-1970 (Community Press, 1970). Davey\u2019s most influential poetry was produced in the early 70\u2019s, with Weeds (Coach House Press, 1970), Four Myths for Sam Perry (Talon Books, 1970), King of swords (Talon Books, 1972), Arcana (Coach House Press, 1973), and The Clallam (Talon Books, 1973). Davey\u2019s criticism of the period was collected in From There to Here: A Guide to English-Canadian Literature Since 1960 (Porcepic Press, 1974), his 1976 essay of the same title, published in Surviving the Paraphrase (Turnstone Press, 1983) and Reading Canadian reading (Turnstone, 1988). bp Nichol wrote an important introduction for Davey\u2019s Selected poems: the arches (Talon Books, 1980). Davey has documented and written on Canadian authors such as Margaret Atwood, Earle Birney, Louis Dudek and Raymond Souster among others, focusing on Canadian small-press poets who would have been looked over by bigger presses. His own poetry appeared in Capitalistic affection (Coach House Press, 1982), Edward and Patricia (Coach House Press, 1984), The Louis Riel organ and piano company (Turnstone, 1985), The Abbotsford guide to India (Porcepic, 1986) and Popular narratives (Talon Books, 1991). Davey founded Swift Current, a literary journal database published from 1984 to 1990. Davey has taught in Montreal, Toronto\u2019s York University, and was the Carl F. Klinck professor of Canadian Literature at the University of Western Ontario at the time of his retirement in 2005. His criticism and poetics of the 90\u2018s include Post-national arguments: the politics of the Anglophone-Canadian novel since 1967 (University of Toronto Press, 1993), Canadian literary power (NeWest, 1994), Reading \u2018Kim\u2019 Right (Talon Books, 1993) and Karla\u2019s Web (Viking, 1994). He continues to publish poetry, Poems Suitable to Current Material Conditions (2014) and Motel Homage for Greg Curnoe (2014) being his most recent publications. "

His last two books Four Myths for Sam Perry and Weeds are at the publishers', and Myths for Sam Perry will be appearing in a month or so. Without further introduction, Frank Davey [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1443126].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:00:36\nThe first poems I'm going to read this evening are ones which came out of my experiences in my first marriage. My own feeling about reading poetry is that the poem is exposed to the audience at a much faster rate than what the poem is when it's on the page, and excuse me, I'm going to give you a fair bit of background material on some of these poems. These are a collection of prose poems.\n \nFrank Davey\n00:01:20\nReads unnamed poem.\n \nFrank Davey\n00:02:13\nReads \u201cCounting\u201d [from Weeds].\n\nFrank Davey\n00:03:11\nReads \"The Bandit\" [from Weeds]. \n \nFrank Davey\n00:04:08\nTo me some of these poems are remarkable because at the time I didn't know this marriage was breaking up and some of the, some of the poems as you can see are about experiences other than marriage and suddenly I realize of course as these poems were progressing, in particular toward the end, that the message was certainly that there was something rather infertile in my whole life, I mean even in the next poem I'm going to read, I didn't catch on, I thought, 'oh well, I'll write this poem, I can't really show it to my wife, but you know, so what'.\n \nFrank Davey\n00:04:44\nReads \"Mealtimes\" [from Weeds].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:05:46\nReads \"The Place\" [from Weeds].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:06:39\nThese poems actually form a sequence, I'm only giving you certain examples of them and jumping ahead and now the cat is suddenly in the next poem as if it hadn't left.\n \nFrank Davey\n00:06:52\nReads \"The Calling\" [from Weeds].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:08:08\nWell by this point in the sequence, the message was beginning to become more available to me. I was, I admit beginning to understand what I was writing by this point. I've always felt that it's important to write a poem whether or not you realize its significance or its relevance to your own life that you go ahead and write the poem anyway. And in this particular sequence, my own faith that poetry can reveal things to you, that the process of writing poems is a process of discovery, that in fact poems teach the poet, rather than the poet teaching the poems. The poems are wiser than the poet, if you want to look at it that way. This was--seemed to be borne out. \n\nFrank Davey\n00:09:15\nReads \"Leaves\" [from Weeds].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:10:25\nReads \"A Letter\" [from Weeds].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:11:35\nReads \"Them Apples\" [from Weeds].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:12:39\nReads \"I Do Not Write Poems\" [from Weeds].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:13:40\nReads \"Red\" [from Weeds].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:14:41\nMany ways experience played into the hands of the poems, very nice that the most disastrous years of that marriage happened to begin in a summertime situation, and to end in winter, so that the seasonal, the cycle of the seasons could play its part in the poem. But on the other hand, perhaps that wasn't accidental. One doesn't want to question these things after they've worked for you. Group of poems that are collected in the book, which Howard Fink spoke about in his introduction, Four Myths for Sam Perry.\n \nFrank Davey\n00:15:39\nReads \"Sentences of Welcome\" from Four Myths for Sam Perry.\n \nFrank Davey\n00:17:00\nI had the fortune, I was going to say good fortune, I had the fortune of being in Los Angeles [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q65] during the Watts Riots in 1965 [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q377682], and living in the riot area. I was very busy at the time and that particular experience I haven't really even begun to deal with.\n \nFrank Davey\n00:17:26\nReads \"Watts, 1965\" [from Four Myths for Sam Perry].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:18:34.12\nAt that time, in Vietnam [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q881], the most contested piece of property was Hill 488. And most of us know that mountains have a peculiar history of being sacred to human beings, Olympus [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q80344], Fuji [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q39231], Sinai [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q377485], there's a mountain in China [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q148] called Tai Shan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q216059], I believe Confucius [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4604] made a pilgrimage up this mountain, which is apparently so sacred that the Chinese had carved thousands of steps all the way up to the summit of the mountain. There are mountains, of course, in the Himalayas [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5451], which house monasteries and which monks so far have successfully prevented anyone from climbing.\n \nFrank Davey\n00:19:39\nReads \"Hill 488\" [from Four Myths for Sam Perry].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:20:27\nDrongo is a purple bird that is peculiar to Southeast Asia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q11708], one of the things which is never really thought of in times of conflict are all of the more, well very specific natural features of the landscape which of course are threatened by destruction in such times. We think of the problems of the defoliant in South Vietnam, when what they estimate now that more than 10% of the country has been treated with defoliant. We don't think of the individual examples of the flora and fauna which may be threatened with extinction because of this defoliation. Man of course is only one of the many inhabitants of this planet and although it is certainly a despicable thing that the biological function of human beings have been interfered with by the defoliation, children are being born malnourished, these are not the only sufferers. \n \nFrank Davey\n00:21:58\nReads \"The Drongo\" [from Four Myths for Sam Perry].\n \nUnknown\n00:23:27\n[Cut or edit made in tape.

I've been somewhat disappointed to learn that all kinds of other poets have been doing this at the same time. They're getting their stuff into print but I haven't bothered because I was going to do all 88 cards and publish them all at once. At any rate, I'm going to say some more about the tarot pack later but this particular poem comes out of the tarot pack from the Emperor card and has a peculiar affinity to the poems I've just been reading.\n \nFrank Davey\n00:25:20\nReads \"The Emperor\" [published later as \u201cManuscript, 4 December, 1970, title \u2018The Emperor\u2019\u201d in Arcana].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:27:03\nReads \"When\" [from Four Myths for Sam Perry]\n \nFrank Davey\n00:27:56\nBut there is also of course, another side of the coin.\n \nFrank Davey\n00:27:59\nReads \"For her, a Spring\" [from Four Myths for Sam Perry].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:30:39\nThe next poem is entitled \"A Light Poem\". For lack of a better descriptive term, I might call myself an anti-humanist, this is of course the--it's almost become a category, I thought it was unique at one point, but it's become of late a category. I think more and more people are realizing that man is not capable of appointing himself as manager, or he's capable of appointing himself, he's not capable of acting out his self-appointment as manager of this planet. That in fact, his capabilities at managing certain areas create problems that are multiples of the ones he has solved. And that the humanist dream of man through his own rationality creating a nearly utopian existence, coming to understand the workings of the universe in such a way that he can bend them to his own use, but this dream has not going to come true. And of course, one of the ways that this feeling in men has been manifested has been his utilization of light and energy, and well, to the poem. \"A Light Poem\".\n \nFrank Davey\n00:32:25\nReads \"A Light Poem\" [from Four Myths for Sam Perry]..\n \nUnknown\n00:37:24\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n\nFrank Davey\n00:37:25\nRecently I have been writing poems from tarot cards. I have noticed a couple of things about the tarot cards that are very important for the poems. One of these is that the female symbol seems to be the most important symbol in the deck and it seems to suggest that the universe itself is essentially feminine in nature, that the fertility of the universe is feminine. Another aspect of the cards suggests that the nature of the universe is such that all sorts of mysterious things can happen to it without our understanding them. That there are all sorts of forces indicated in these cards that are essentially outside of our control. This poem, entitled \"To Win at Cards\". Tarot cards are not cards whose primary purpose is to play a game. The decks of cards with which we are all familiar with are cards where you play a game, the object of course of playing cards is to win at cards. And winning of course, is something which we are all brought up to wish, so one of the things about our competitive society that makes it work is that we all want to win. And card games help indoctrinate us in this direction. Cards, can also tell you things, this is the thing that the tarot cards have in common with poetry, is that people don't win in poetry, you don't write a better poem than somebody else in order to win prizes or to--you don't use poems in order to seduce a girl, or you don't use poems in order to accomplish any kind of end outside of the end of writing the poem. If you do, your allegiance is not to the poem and it's to something else and you're prostituting the poem. The only thing which can win at poetry is the poem itself, and this is where the poet ought to apply his effort to, is to helping the poem win.\n \nFrank Davey\n00:40:15\nReads \"To Win at Cards\" published later in Arcana].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:41:20\nThis poem, entitled \"The Hermit\", one of the figures on the cards. The card happened to cause me to recall a childhood memory of an earthquake.\n \nFrank Davey\n00:41:35\nReads \"The Hermit\" [published later in Arcana].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:42:49\nIt became very clear to me writing these Tarot poems that indeed there were many things outside of one's control and my wife and I were putting together a jigsaw puzzle of the moon, I think it was a satellite photograph of one side of the moon, and things started to go wrong.\n \nFrank Davey\n00:43:16\nReads [\u201cLuna\u201d, published later in Arcana].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:44:52\nThroughout history of course, men have been obsessed with the idea of being displaced by another man. Either in the seat--in the kingdom, or in the favors of the special woman in their lives. We have in mythology of course, many myths of Gods being displaced very often by their children. In Greek drama of course, the classical example is the Oedipus [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q130890] myth where Laius [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q463898] and Jocasta [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q131445] have their married lives disrupted by their son, Oedipus. This is a poem about this particular fear. Fear of being displaced by someone younger, very often, fear of being displaced by one's own son, although that's not necessarily integral to the poem.\n \nFrank Davey\n00:45:53\nReads [\"Menelaus, To You\", published later in Arcana].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:47:19\nIf you choose to go to war with the natural environment, strange things happen. \u201cKing of Pentacles\u201d is wrapped in a coat of binds.\n \nFrank Davey\n00:47:34\nReads \"King of Pentacles\" [published later in Arcana].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:48:44\nTimes when men do the right things, or seem to do the right things. A poem called \"The Caughnawaga Bell\".\n \nFrank Davey\n00:48:55\nReads \"The Caughnawaga Bell\" [published later in Arcana].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:50:32\nI'd like to conclude with a couple of poems about the whole problem of writing. It's always a problem for a poet to keep the process of writing going. One of the tricks of poets of course is always to write poems about the fact that the process of writing isn't going. I have a number of these. \"The Mountain\".\n \nFrank Davey\n00:51:06\nReads \"The Mountain\" [from Four Myths for Sam Perry].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:51:50\nOf course, the thing is, as soon as you begin to pay homage to the fact that you're having trouble writing a poem and express your will to, you are in fact being repaid. As soon as I remembered this myth of Popocatepetl [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1782392] and you know, the earth literally repaying the boy for his homage representing him with a mountain. If you couldn't grow corn on it, at least you could lure the Yankees down to look at. [Audience laughter].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:52:24\nReads \"The Bells\" [from Four Myths for Sam Perry].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:53:33\nThis poem, entitled \"The Making\".\n \nFrank Davey\n00:53:41\nReads \"The Making\" [from Four Myths for Sam Perry].\n \nFrank Davey\n00:55:34\nAnd so, I wish you all good winds!\n \nEND\n00:55:37\n",

                "notes": "Poet Tom Raworth was born in 1938 and grew up in the outskirts of London. Raworth left grammar school at sixteen and pursued many odd jobs, frequented all-night jazz clubs while writing a collaborative secret-agent novel in addition to his own poetry. He married in the late 50\u2019s and had three children. In 1963 he was publishing and printing his own magazine, Outburst, meeting the likes of Michael Horowitz, Anselm Hollo, David Ball, publishing Robert Creeley, Ed Dorn, Charles Olson, LeRoi Jones and Gregory Corso. His first book of verse, The Minicab War (Matrix Press) was a collaboration with Hollo and Corso in 1961. Under Matrix Press, he published Dorn\u2019s From Gloucester Out, and Hollo\u2019s History. Raworth met Barry Hall and in 1965, they formed Goliard Press and published books by Charles Olson, and Ron Padgett. Jonathan Cape\u2019s publishing house and Goliard merged in 1967, becoming Cape Goliard Press, publishing Olson\u2019s The Maximus Poems in 1970. The Relation Ship (Cape Goliard Press) was published in 1966, re-printed in 1969, and drew the attention of Donald Davie and Dorn at University of Essex, who offered him the opportunity to continue his education. The Relation Ship won the Alice Hunt Bartlett prize in 1969. Raworth also published smaller collections of poetry, Continuation in 1966 (Goliard), Haiku (another collaboration with Hollo and John Esam) in 1968 (Trigram Press), and Betrayal in 1969. A Serial Biography (Fulcrum Press) published in 1969 spawned from a correspondence with Ed Dorn, and culminated with correspondences from letters with Park magazine. Written in 1968 while Raworth was studying Spanish at the University of Granada, (through the University of Essex), Lion Lion (Trigram Press) was published in 1970. Over the subsequent two decades, Raworth took up position as poet-in-residence at King\u2019s College, Cambridge for a year, and published over a dozen other books, including Ace (The Figures Press, 1974), Cloister (Sand Project Press, 1975), Logbook (Poltroon Press, 1977), Nicht Wahr, Rosie? (Poltroon Press,1980), and Lazy Left Hand: Notes from 1970-1975 (Actual Size Press,1986). His poems were later compiled in Collected Poems (Carcanet, 2003). Raworth died in 2017."

And who has, as they say, paid his dues, and in that time, won all the prizes, like the President's Medal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q39089691], and the Governor General's Award [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q283256], and countless numbers of Canada Council [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2993809] Grants and all those other things that come to you. [Laughter]. Currently, I don't know if whether or not I'm supposed to mention this or not, but currently making an excursion amongst the academics at...in other words, straightening people out at Simon Fraser University [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q201603]. And a very welcome addition to our series. Al Purdy. \n \nUnknown\n00:00:55\n[Cut or edit in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed]. \n \nAl Purdy\n00:00:56\nWhen I started to write poems about sixty-eight years ago, Bliss Carman [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3068116] was the only one writing. So I imitated Bliss Carman, and this first poem is a sort of imitation of Bliss Carman. [Audience laughter]. And there are hardly any new poems in there because it takes me two years to revise them for two years and then conclude them in a reading, and then besides which as George [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1239280] said, I've joined the academics because all the American members of the department at Simon Fraser have guilty consciences so they wanted a Canadian on staff [audience laughter].  \"About being a member of our armed forces\". This is, this is thirty years after I started to write poems. Remember--Oh, I should say, there are two, three phrases in this that would not ordinarily be understood by you people. \"Zombies,\" who were conscripts in the last war, and well, the CWACs were women members, Canadian Women's Army Corp [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5030688]. And during the early part of the last war, there were no rifles. So they used wooden rifles to drill with. \n \nAl Purdy\n00:02:09\nReads \"About Being a Member of Our Armed Forces\" [from Selected Poems; audience laughter throughout].\n \nAl Purdy\n00:03:29\nAs I said, I've become an academic lately, and one of the students in this class has asked for all my cigar tubes, little metal tubes that, you know, I get cigars in. He wants to put poems in them and float them down the North Saskatchewan River [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2237] [audience laughter]. And for some reason or other, this, that became the title of this particular poem. \"Floating Down the North Saskatchewan River\". [Audience laughter].\n \nAl Purdy\n00:04:01\nReads \"Floating Down the North Saskatchewan River\" [audience laughter throughout].\n \nAl Purdy\n00:04:40\nFunny, eh? [Audience laughter]. Something called \"Jubilate\", and I'm going to leave that out of there. \"Flight 17 Eastbound\". Ah...I keep revising some of these and I'm reading now from manuscript because I revised a lot of the poems here and I can't remember which ones I revised, so if they're in manuscript I'm sure they're either revised or that there's some reason for them being there. \n \nAl Purdy\n00:05:13\nReads \"Flight 17 Eastbound\".\n \nAl Purdy\n00:06:47\nI don't know what that means but it must be profound. [Audience laughter]. I'm getting together a collection of love poems, or I have gotten a collection of love poems together. They are, I am told, fairly hard-boiled love poems. Because when Jack McClelland [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6113965], of McClelland and Stewart [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6800322], heard about them they thought it was a good idea that Harold Town [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q827127] should do some illustrations. But when they saw the poems, and of course it wasn't because they were bad poems, I'm sure, he didn't want to do the illustrations anymore, they said they were hard-boiled. As I said, they can't be bad poems. This was one of them. It's got...no, I don't think I'll read that anyway. I don't like it. However, here's another one along the same lines. [Audience laughter]. It's called \"With Words, Words\".\n \nAl Purdy\n00:07:51\nReads \"With Words, Words\" [from Love in a burning building].\n \nAl Purdy\n00:10:49\nI lived in Vancouver [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q24639] for a while, and up till 1955 or 6. The first play I wrote for CBC [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q461761] was accepted, and I thought I was a genius, and moved to Montreal  [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q340] in order to reap the rewards of my genius. For a year in Montreal I think my...I sold a couple of adaptations to CBC. And eventually we moved to Roblin Lake [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q22447801], near Ameliasburgh [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4742321] in Ontario [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1904], and built a house. And my wife having quit her job, she having decided that if I could get away without working she could too. So we sat down for a couple of years looking at each other, waiting for the other one, to see which one would break first. But this is a poem about that particular time, called \"One Rural Winter\".\n \nAl Purdy\n00:11:50\nReads \"One Rural Winter\" [from Selected Poems; audience laughter throughout].\n \nAl Purdy\n00:15:22\nI was in the Arctic [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q25322] in '65, but this is a poem written long after that about the Arctic. And I suppose...certainly about the Canadian Arctic. I called it \"Arctic Romance\", but I think it should be just \"Arctic\", or something like that.\n \nAl Purdy\n00:15:46\nReads \"Arctic Romance\".\n \nAl Purdy\n00:17:13\nScrewed that up, I guess. You get tired of reading your own stuff, after a while. You forget what it sounded like the last time. This is a poem I kind of like but I keep revising it also, or have been several times in the last few years, called \"Dark Landscape\". It uses a couple of lines from an American poet who died thirty years ago called Vachel Lindsay [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1197667], whom probably nobody ever heard of. And it starts in a very prosy way, and is meant to sound that way, and then the rhythm quickens. \"Dark Landscape\".\n \nAl Purdy\n00:18:07\nReads \"Dark Landscape\".\n \nAl Purdy\n00:21:45\nIn case anybody is wondering about the particular Vachel Lindsay line, it was \"The spring comes on forever, and the Chinese nightingale\". And he also had \"Aladdin to the jinn\", except that Aladdin to the jinn, his jinn was J-I-N-N and mine was two J-I-N-N's, and one G-I-N. So that, always a little difficult to understand it without seeing it on the page. Kind of a sweet little poem, this was after we moved to Roblin Lake, and as I say, I sold a couple of plays and we bought a pile of used lumber with the proceeds and put the down payment on the lot and build this house. \n \nAl Purdy\n00:22:27\nReads \"Winter at Roblin Lake\" [from The Cariboo Horses].\n \nAl Purdy\n00:22:52\nAlso the same period, about building the house, or rather after the house was built. Trouble is, you can't, you can't smoke a cigar here, can you, something I...it always goes out. Anyway. \"Interruption\". \n \nAl Purdy\n00:23:13\nReads \"Interruption\" [from Selected Poems].\n \nAl Purdy\n00:24:49\nWhen I...when we first moved down to Ameliasburg, or to Roblin Lake, I should say, because Roblin Lake where we are is about a mile or so from Ameliasburg...I, after Montreal, and after the job I'd had in Vancouver, I suddenly had to become my own disciplinary straw boss, and it was quite difficult, and in other words, you know, I'd try to get up at a certain hour of the day and start writing. Which I could always, you know, I can always write prose, whenever I feel like it, but poems, I write them, well, I should say, I write poems whenever I feel like it, but you can, I can regimen my own prose, which I don't do much of these days. Anyway, when we moved to Roblin Lake, I wasn't physically regimented myself, so that I was waking up all hours of the day. And this is a short poem about that, but I also screwed up the poem, because I put lines at the end of, or words at the end of each line so that I don't know where the emphasis should be placed, even though I've read it dozens of times. It's called \"Late Rising at Roblin Lake\".\n \nAl Purdy\n00:25:57\nReads \"Late Rising at Roblin Lake\" [from The Cariboo Horses].\n \nAl Purdy\n00:26:47\nAnother poem about the same particular period, called \"Wilderness Gothic\". Uh...don't think there's a thing to say about this particular poem at all. \n \nAl Purdy\n00:27:03\nReads \"Wilderness Gothic\" [from Selected Poems].\n \nAl Purdy\n00:29:33\nWhen you read a bunch of poems over several years, I think you pick out the ones that you think will read the best, which is certainly what I do, because there are many of my own poems that I rarely read, or never read at all. In fact I, I never read this one. It's called \"Love Poem\".\n \nAl Purdy\n00:29:58\nReads \"Love Poem\" [from Poems for all the Annettes].\n \nAl Purdy\n00:31:40\nIn...This poem dates, the actual time of the poem dates about fifteen years ago. The poem itself was written about five years ago. At the time, a friend of mine was there also, which, other than his particular presence I might have acted a little bit differently than I did. You'll see what I mean in a, when I read the poem. Because nobody would take this chance in placing themselves in such a vulnerable position with a woman. \"Homemade Beer\".\n \nAl Purdy\n00:32:12\nReads \"Homemade Beer\" [from The Cariboo Horses].\n \nAudience\n00:33:48\nLaughter.\n \nUnknown\n00:33:51\n[Cut or edit in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n \nAl Purdy\n00:33:52\nOne called \"The Drunk Tank\". It's...Dates back two or three years ago when, after the time when I was in the Air Force [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q25456], a friend of mine got out of the Air Force much later, so we celebrated. And...it was after quite a turbulent evening with my friend in Belleville [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q34227], Ontario, we decided to get a couple of bottles of liquor and go out to the country where we wouldn't be disturbed, and drink it. But the farmer phoned the cops, and we were both thrown in jail. And this particular poem is about the first part of that experience, I mean the early part of being thrown in jail, more or less. But not the end of it, it turned into a sort of fantasy that means something other than I intended. \n \nAl Purdy\n00:34:43\nReads \"The Drunk Tank\" [from The Poems of Al Purdy].\n \nAl Purdy\n00:36:51\nThis is called \"Poem for Rita\", and about a couple of years ago in Toronto [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q172], there was a couple of girls staying with myself, my wife and myself, and she kept asking me to write a poem. So after a while, I wrote this.\n \nAl Purdy\n00:37:10\nReads \"Poem for Rita\".\n \nAudience\n00:37:25\nLaughter.\n \nAl Purdy\n00:37:28\nThat's all. [Audience laughter]. I think it was actually kind of unkind on my part, because I was never sure whether she understood that or not, and I didn't know whether I wanted her to understand it. [Audience laughter]. There...when we first moved to Ameliasburg, as I mentioned, I was broke as hell. And after having lived in Vancouver, I learned how to make wine of one kind or another, and there was no way to, I didn't have enough money to make beer, so there were a lot of wild grapes around there and we made, I made wild grape wine, and one time, one particular season, I had about five hundred bottles. [Audience laughter]. I attribute the effects of this wine to having made me what I am today [audience laughter], if I could figure that out. But the poem eventually came out of it, called \"The Winemaker's Beatitude\".\n \nAl Purdy\n00:38:39\nReads \"The Winemaker's Beatitude\" [from Selected Poems].\n \nAl Purdy\n00:41:16\nIn '65, I went up to Baffin Island [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q81178] on some government money, public money, rode a commercial airline plane from Montreal to Frobisher Bay [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1004067], hitchhiked a ride on what I thought was a DOT plane, but was a construction plane, a construction company charter, and then at Pangnirtung [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q631747], which is on the Arctic Circle, the original administrator there arranged that I go along with an Eskimo family in their canoe to some islands in Cumberland Sound [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q938327]. A year and a half after I got back from the Arctic, I got a bill for a hundred and ten dollars from the construction company that I thought I'd, whose plane I thought I'd hitchhiked on. Which I haven't paid. But anyway, all of these poems, except perhaps I think one or two, were written up there, written in the Arctic, except that after I got back from the Arctic I kept revising them. So you can make up your own mind whether they're written there or not. Among the poems here, there's one called \"At the Movies\".\n \nAl Purdy\n00:42:37\nReads \"At the Movies\" [from North of Summer].\n\n Al Purdy\n00:44:55\nThe business about the caribou draining in the bilge water was one of the reasons, I suppose, I found it so extraordinary that, perhaps, that Eskimos should enjoy these shoot-em-up movies, was that they had just come a hundred miles or so after shooting caribou, bringing them back to Pang, Pangnirtung on the, on the Sound, on the...jeez, my memory's failing, I can't even remember the fjord it was. But anyway, they had just shot them and come a hundred miles back with them, and yet...and they were draining in their Peterhead boats, and yet they found these movies so exciting--I suppose I shouldn't find that so unusual, but I do. A crappy Hollywood [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q34006] movie. And here's one called \"The Sculptors\".\n \nAl Purdy\n00:45:50\nReads \"The Sculptors\" [from North of Summer].\n\nAl Purdy\n00:48:17\nI think I'm going to have about time for two more, so that I'd better...I could probably go on, oh I'd better make it three more  I'll give ya...this is, the trees in the Arctic are about, are very low, and well, this is treeless country on Baffin Island, where there, where practically nothing grows except moss and that, and the like of that, but I wrote a poem about trees at the Arctic Circle, and this is it....I see I'm getting, I'm only talking about the physical things about the Arctic, and I have some poems about the people, too, which, which I should read. Anyway, \"Trees at the Arctic Circle\".\n \nAl Purdy\n00:49:05\nReads \"Trees at the Arctic Circle\" [from North of Summer].\n \nAl Purdy\n00:51:07\nI want to read at least one about, about, about people there, because I used to, when I was on these islands, [inaudible] Islands in Cumberland Sound, the Eskimo women used to come over every day and drink tea. They could not speak any English and I could speak no Eskimo, and I would feed them tea and we would sit there, myself feeling about as silly as I could, so eventually I grew a bit desperate and I would read them poems and I would sing songs or I'd do any damn thing. However, eventually there was some kind of, I think, positive liking on my part. But this poem may express it as well as anything. \"Wash Day\".\n \nAl Purdy\n00:51:54\nReads \"Wash Day\" [from North of Summer].\n \nAl Purdy\n00:54:03\nTalking about shit, there's actually a poem that has a little bit to do with it here. The Arctic dogs have some qualities that are more pronounced and magnified in Arctic dogs than in southern dogs, that is, they like to eat the stuff. So that when you go, as all, everybody must go at some time or other in their lives, possibly once a day or not, one takes an Eskimo kid along to throw stones and keep the dogs off. When I came back from the Arctic I saw an hour-long film about the George River [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q966023] Eskimos, and one scene in it showed about fifty Eskimos trying to get into a tent, and the Eskimos beating them into the tent, and the next thing you showed the same dogs trying to get out of the tent and the Eskimos beating them out of the tent. And the announcer said not one single word. And then I remembered that whenever the Eskimos leave a campsite, they use it for a privy, and then send the dogs in to clean up. So, actually, this is a poem about that.  \"When I Sat Down to Play the Piano\". [Audience laughter].\n \nAl Purdy\n00:55:10\nReads \"When I Sat Down to Play the Piano\" [from North of Summer; audience laughter throughout].\n\nAl Purdy\n00:58:23\nI've got one more poem if my voice can hold out. When Robert Kennedy  [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q25310] was shot...I always think about anything that I'm interested and emotionally moved by, always, at least I have in the past, till I got to Simon Fraser, think about writing a poem about it. So the same thing was happening after Kennedy was shot and died, and I was thinking about writing a poem about it, and then the Star Weekly [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q17112122] phoned up and asked me to write a poem about it. So this poem eventually got written. \"A Lament for Robert Kennedy\".\n \nAl Purdy\n00:59:06\nReads \"A Lament for Robert Kennedy\".\n\nAudience\n01:04:39\nApplause.\n \nEND\n01:04:55\n"

                "notes": "Canadian poet Al Purdy was born on December 30, 1918, in Wooler, Ontario of United Empire Loyalists. Purdy attended Dufferin Public school in Trenton, Albert Collegiate in Belleville and Trenton Collegiate Institute, writing poems along the way. During the Second World War, Purdy enrolled in the RCAF, serving most at the remote base Woodcock, on the Skeena River in northern British Columbia. Purdy married Eurithe Mary Jane Parkurst in 1941, and they had a son, Alfred. His first collection of poems was The Enchanted Echo (Clarke & Stuart Company, 1944), but it was his second collection, Pressed on Sand (Ryerson Press, 1955) that showcased Purdy\u2019s literary accomplishment. Despite this, he worked odd jobs across the country, and published poems and short stories in magazines like North and The Beaver. Purdy received his first Canada Council grant in 1960, and published Poems for all the Annettes (Contact Press, 1962) and The Cariboo horses (McClelland & Stewart, 1965) which won a Governor General\u2019s Award. His next publication, North of summer: poems from Baffin Island (McClelland & Stewart, 1967) came out of a second Canada Council Grant, which he spent in the Baffin Islands, and was followed by Wild Grape Wine (McClelland & Stewart, 1968). That year, Purdy also became an editor for the Tamarack Review, an anthology, The New Romans, and Fifteen Winds. Purdy has published dozens more collections of poetry along with writing in other genres, including In search of Owen Roblin (McClelland & Stewart, 1974), autobiographical essays, No Other Country (McClelland & Stewart, 1977), Being alive: poems 1958-78 (McClelland & Stewart, 1978), a memoir, Morning and it\u2019s summer (1983), a collection of letters, The Bukowski\/Purdy letters 1964-1984 (Quadrant Editions, 1983), his only novel A Splinter in the Heart (McClelland & Stewart, 1990), a selection of prose recollections, Reaching for the Beaufort Sea: an autobiography (Harbour Publishing,1993), and Starting from Ameliasburgh: the collected prose of Al Purdy (Harbour Publishing, 1995). Purdy\u2019s The Collected Poems of Al Purdy, 1956-1986 (McClelland & Stewart, 1986) won his second Governor General\u2019s Award, and he was appointed to the Order of Canada in 1982 and the Order of Ontario in 1987. Dividing most of his time between North Saanich, B.C. and Roblin Lake, Ontario, Purdy supported himself through his poetry, guest lecturing, readings and editing. Al Purdy died in North Saanich, on April 21, 2000. His last collection of poetry, Beyond Remembering: The Collected Poems of Al Purdy (Harbour Publishing, 2000) was released posthumously. The Voice of the Land Award was created to honour Purdy\u2019s contributions to Canadian poetry."

                "contents": "George Bowering\n00:00:00\nAs you know, the reader tonight is Al Purdy [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4704621], a man who's been described as, by Doug Featherling, as the most Canadian of all possible poets. And who has, as they say, paid his dues, and in that time, won all the prizes, like the President's Medal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q39089691], and the Governor General's Award [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q283256], and countless numbers of Canada Council [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2993809] Grants and all those other things that come to you. [Laughter]. Currently, I don't know if whether or not I'm supposed to mention this or not, but currently making an excursion amongst the academics at...in other words, straightening people out at Simon Fraser University [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q201603]. And a very welcome addition to our series. Al Purdy. \n \nUnknown\n00:00:55\n[Cut or edit in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed]. \n \nAl Purdy\n00:00:56\nWhen I started to write poems about sixty-eight years ago, Bliss Carman [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3068116] was the only one writing. So I imitated Bliss Carman, and this first poem is a sort of imitation of Bliss Carman. [Audience laughter]. And there are hardly any new poems in there because it takes me two years to revise them for two years and then conclude them in a reading, and then besides which as George [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1239280] said, I've joined the academics because all the American members of the department at Simon Fraser have guilty consciences so they wanted a Canadian on staff [audience laughter].  \"About being a member of our armed forces\". This is, this is thirty years after I started to write poems. Remember--Oh, I should say, there are two, three phrases in this that would not ordinarily be understood by you people. \"Zombies,\" who were conscripts in the last war, and well, the CWACs were women members, Canadian Women's Army Corp [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5030688]. And during the early part of the last war, there were no rifles. So they used wooden rifles to drill with. \n \nAl Purdy\n00:02:09\nReads \"About Being a Member of Our Armed Forces\" [from Selected Poems; audience laughter throughout].\n \nAl Purdy\n00:03:29\nAs I said, I've become an academic lately, and one of the students in this class has asked for all my cigar tubes, little metal tubes that, you know, I get cigars in. He wants to put poems in them and float them down the North Saskatchewan River [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2237] [audience laughter]. And for some reason or other, this, that became the title of this particular poem. \"Floating Down the North Saskatchewan River\". [Audience laughter].\n \nAl Purdy\n00:04:01\nReads \"Floating Down the North Saskatchewan River\" [audience laughter throughout].\n \nAl Purdy\n00:04:40\nFunny, eh? [Audience laughter]. Something called \"Jubilate\", and I'm going to leave that out of there. \"Flight 17 Eastbound\". Ah...I keep revising some of these and I'm reading now from manuscript because I revised a lot of the poems here and I can't remember which ones I revised, so if they're in manuscript I'm sure they're either revised or that there's some reason for them being there. \n \nAl Purdy\n00:05:13\nReads \"Flight 17 Eastbound\".\n \nAl Purdy\n00:06:47\nI don't know what that means but it must be profound. [Audience laughter]. I'm getting together a collection of love poems, or I have gotten a collection of love poems together. They are, I am told, fairly hard-boiled love poems. Because when Jack McClelland [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6113965], of McClelland and Stewart [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6800322], heard about them they thought it was a good idea that Harold Town [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q827127] should do some illustrations. But when they saw the poems, and of course it wasn't because they were bad poems, I'm sure, he didn't want to do the illustrations anymore, they said they were hard-boiled. As I said, they can't be bad poems. This was one of them. It's got...no, I don't think I'll read that anyway. I don't like it. However, here's another one along the same lines. [Audience laughter]. It's called \"With Words, Words\".\n \nAl Purdy\n00:07:51\nReads \"With Words, Words\" [from Love in a burning building].\n \nAl Purdy\n00:10:49\nI lived in Vancouver [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q24639] for a while, and up till 1955 or 6. The first play I wrote for CBC [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q461761] was accepted, and I thought I was a genius, and moved to Montreal  [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q340] in order to reap the rewards of my genius. For a year in Montreal I think my...I sold a couple of adaptations to CBC. And eventually we moved to Roblin Lake [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q22447801], near Ameliasburgh [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4742321] in Ontario [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1904], and built a house. And my wife having quit her job, she having decided that if I could get away without working she could too. So we sat down for a couple of years looking at each other, waiting for the other one, to see which one would break first. But this is a poem about that particular time, called \"One Rural Winter\".\n \nAl Purdy\n00:11:50\nReads \"One Rural Winter\" [from Selected Poems; audience laughter throughout].\n \nAl Purdy\n00:15:22\nI was in the Arctic [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q25322] in '65, but this is a poem written long after that about the Arctic. And I suppose...certainly about the Canadian Arctic. I called it \"Arctic Romance\", but I think it should be just \"Arctic\", or something like that.\n \nAl Purdy\n00:15:46\nReads \"Arctic Romance\".\n \nAl Purdy\n00:17:13\nScrewed that up, I guess. You get tired of reading your own stuff, after a while. You forget what it sounded like the last time. This is a poem I kind of like but I keep revising it also, or have been several times in the last few years, called \"Dark Landscape\". It uses a couple of lines from an American poet who died thirty years ago called Vachel Lindsay [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1197667], whom probably nobody ever heard of. And it starts in a very prosy way, and is meant to sound that way, and then the rhythm quickens. \"Dark Landscape\".\n \nAl Purdy\n00:18:07\nReads \"Dark Landscape\".\n \nAl Purdy\n00:21:45\nIn case anybody is wondering about the particular Vachel Lindsay line, it was \"The spring comes on forever, and the Chinese nightingale\". And he also had \"Aladdin to the jinn\", except that Aladdin to the jinn, his jinn was J-I-N-N and mine was two J-I-N-N's, and one G-I-N. So that, always a little difficult to understand it without seeing it on the page. Kind of a sweet little poem, this was after we moved to Roblin Lake, and as I say, I sold a couple of plays and we bought a pile of used lumber with the proceeds and put the down payment on the lot and build this house. \n \nAl Purdy\n00:22:27\nReads \"Winter at Roblin Lake\" [from The Cariboo Horses].\n \nAl Purdy\n00:22:52\nAlso the same period, about building the house, or rather after the house was built. Trouble is, you can't, you can't smoke a cigar here, can you, something I...it always goes out. Anyway. \"Interruption\". \n \nAl Purdy\n00:23:13\nReads \"Interruption\" [from Selected Poems].\n \nAl Purdy\n00:24:49\nWhen I...when we first moved down to Ameliasburg, or to Roblin Lake, I should say, because Roblin Lake where we are is about a mile or so from Ameliasburg...I, after Montreal, and after the job I'd had in Vancouver, I suddenly had to become my own disciplinary straw boss, and it was quite difficult, and in other words, you know, I'd try to get up at a certain hour of the day and start writing. Which I could always, you know, I can always write prose, whenever I feel like it, but poems, I write them, well, I should say, I write poems whenever I feel like it, but you can, I can regimen my own prose, which I don't do much of these days. Anyway, when we moved to Roblin Lake, I wasn't physically regimented myself, so that I was waking up all hours of the day. And this is a short poem about that, but I also screwed up the poem, because I put lines at the end of, or words at the end of each line so that I don't know where the emphasis should be placed, even though I've read it dozens of times. It's called \"Late Rising at Roblin Lake\".\n \nAl Purdy\n00:25:57\nReads \"Late Rising at Roblin Lake\" [from The Cariboo Horses].\n \nAl Purdy\n00:26:47\nAnother poem about the same particular period, called \"Wilderness Gothic\". Uh...don't think there's a thing to say about this particular poem at all. \n \nAl Purdy\n00:27:03\nReads \"Wilderness Gothic\" [from Selected Poems].\n \nAl Purdy\n00:29:33\nWhen you read a bunch of poems over several years, I think you pick out the ones that you think will read the best, which is certainly what I do, because there are many of my own poems that I rarely read, or never read at all. In fact I, I never read this one. It's called \"Love Poem\".\n \nAl Purdy\n00:29:58\nReads \"Love Poem\" [from Poems for all the Annettes].\n \nAl Purdy\n00:31:40\nIn...This poem dates, the actual time of the poem dates about fifteen years ago. The poem itself was written about five years ago. At the time, a friend of mine was there also, which, other than his particular presence I might have acted a little bit differently than I did. You'll see what I mean in a, when I read the poem. Because nobody would take this chance in placing themselves in such a vulnerable position with a woman. \"Homemade Beer\".\n \nAl Purdy\n00:32:12\nReads \"Homemade Beer\" [from The Cariboo Horses].\n \nAudience\n00:33:48\nLaughter.\n \nUnknown\n00:33:51\n[Cut or edit in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n \nAl Purdy\n00:33:52\nOne called \"The Drunk Tank\". It's...Dates back two or three years ago when, after the time when I was in the Air Force [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q25456], a friend of mine got out of the Air Force much later, so we celebrated. And...it was after quite a turbulent evening with my friend in Belleville [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q34227], Ontario, we decided to get a couple of bottles of liquor and go out to the country where we wouldn't be disturbed, and drink it. But the farmer phoned the cops, and we were both thrown in jail. And this particular poem is about the first part of that experience, I mean the early part of being thrown in jail, more or less. But not the end of it, it turned into a sort of fantasy that means something other than I intended. \n \nAl Purdy\n00:34:43\nReads \"The Drunk Tank\" [from The Poems of Al Purdy].\n \nAl Purdy\n00:36:51\nThis is called \"Poem for Rita\", and about a couple of years ago in Toronto [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q172], there was a couple of girls staying with myself, my wife and myself, and she kept asking me to write a poem. So after a while, I wrote this.\n \nAl Purdy\n00:37:10\nReads \"Poem for Rita\".\n \nAudience\n00:37:25\nLaughter.\n \nAl Purdy\n00:37:28\nThat's all. [Audience laughter]. I think it was actually kind of unkind on my part, because I was never sure whether she understood that or not, and I didn't know whether I wanted her to understand it. [Audience laughter]. There...when we first moved to Ameliasburg, as I mentioned, I was broke as hell. And after having lived in Vancouver, I learned how to make wine of one kind or another, and there was no way to, I didn't have enough money to make beer, so there were a lot of wild grapes around there and we made, I made wild grape wine, and one time, one particular season, I had about five hundred bottles. [Audience laughter]. I attribute the effects of this wine to having made me what I am today [audience laughter], if I could figure that out. But the poem eventually came out of it, called \"The Winemaker's Beatitude\".\n \nAl Purdy\n00:38:39\nReads \"The Winemaker's Beatitude\" [from Selected Poems].\n \nAl Purdy\n00:41:16\nIn '65, I went up to Baffin Island [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q81178] on some government money, public money, rode a commercial airline plane from Montreal to Frobisher Bay [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1004067], hitchhiked a ride on what I thought was a DOT plane, but was a construction plane, a construction company charter, and then at Pangnirtung [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q631747], which is on the Arctic Circle, the original administrator there arranged that I go along with an Eskimo family in their canoe to some islands in Cumberland Sound [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q938327]. A year and a half after I got back from the Arctic, I got a bill for a hundred and ten dollars from the construction company that I thought I'd, whose plane I thought I'd hitchhiked on. Which I haven't paid. But anyway, all of these poems, except perhaps I think one or two, were written up there, written in the Arctic, except that after I got back from the Arctic I kept revising them. So you can make up your own mind whether they're written there or not. Among the poems here, there's one called \"At the Movies\".\n \nAl Purdy\n00:42:37\nReads \"At the Movies\" [from North of Summer].\n\n Al Purdy\n00:44:55\nThe business about the caribou draining in the bilge water was one of the reasons, I suppose, I found it so extraordinary that, perhaps, that Eskimos should enjoy these shoot-em-up movies, was that they had just come a hundred miles or so after shooting caribou, bringing them back to Pang, Pangnirtung on the, on the Sound, on the...jeez, my memory's failing, I can't even remember the fjord it was. But anyway, they had just shot them and come a hundred miles back with them, and yet...and they were draining in their Peterhead boats, and yet they found these movies so exciting--I suppose I shouldn't find that so unusual, but I do. A crappy Hollywood [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q34006] movie. And here's one called \"The Sculptors\".\n \nAl Purdy\n00:45:50\nReads \"The Sculptors\" [from North of Summer].\n\nAl Purdy\n00:48:17\nI think I'm going to have about time for two more, so that I'd better...I could probably go on, oh I'd better make it three more  I'll give ya...this is, the trees in the Arctic are about, are very low, and well, this is treeless country on Baffin Island, where there, where practically nothing grows except moss and that, and the like of that, but I wrote a poem about trees at the Arctic Circle, and this is it....I see I'm getting, I'm only talking about the physical things about the Arctic, and I have some poems about the people, too, which, which I should read. Anyway, \"Trees at the Arctic Circle\".\n \nAl Purdy\n00:49:05\nReads \"Trees at the Arctic Circle\" [from North of Summer].\n \nAl Purdy\n00:51:07\nI want to read at least one about, about, about people there, because I used to, when I was on these islands, [inaudible] Islands in Cumberland Sound, the Eskimo women used to come over every day and drink tea. They could not speak any English and I could speak no Eskimo, and I would feed them tea and we would sit there, myself feeling about as silly as I could, so eventually I grew a bit desperate and I would read them poems and I would sing songs or I'd do any damn thing. However, eventually there was some kind of, I think, positive liking on my part. But this poem may express it as well as anything. \"Wash Day\".\n \nAl Purdy\n00:51:54\nReads \"Wash Day\" [from North of Summer].\n \nAl Purdy\n00:54:03\nTalking about shit, there's actually a poem that has a little bit to do with it here. The Arctic dogs have some qualities that are more pronounced and magnified in Arctic dogs than in southern dogs, that is, they like to eat the stuff. So that when you go, as all, everybody must go at some time or other in their lives, possibly once a day or not, one takes an Eskimo kid along to throw stones and keep the dogs off. When I came back from the Arctic I saw an hour-long film about the George River [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q966023] Eskimos, and one scene in it showed about fifty Eskimos trying to get into a tent, and the Eskimos beating them into the tent, and the next thing you showed the same dogs trying to get out of the tent and the Eskimos beating them out of the tent. And the announcer said not one single word. And then I remembered that whenever the Eskimos leave a campsite, they use it for a privy, and then send the dogs in to clean up. So, actually, this is a poem about that.  \"When I Sat Down to Play the Piano\". [Audience laughter].\n \nAl Purdy\n00:55:10\nReads \"When I Sat Down to Play the Piano\" [from North of Summer; audience laughter throughout].\n\nAl Purdy\n00:58:23\nI've got one more poem if my voice can hold out. When Robert Kennedy  [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q25310] was shot...I always think about anything that I'm interested and emotionally moved by, always, at least I have in the past, till I got to Simon Fraser, think about writing a poem about it. So the same thing was happening after Kennedy was shot and died, and I was thinking about writing a poem about it, and then the Star Weekly [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q17112122] phoned up and asked me to write a poem about it. So this poem eventually got written. \"A Lament for Robert Kennedy\".\n \nAl Purdy\n00:59:06\nReads \"A Lament for Robert Kennedy\".\n\nAudience\n01:04:39\nApplause.\n \nEND\n01:04:55\n",

Joel Oppenheimer, thank you.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:00:44\nI really didn't like, George [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1239280], being referred to as being a Black Mountain blah blah blah. I happen to be the finest softball pitcher Black Mountain ever had. And so that none of you lose any sleep tonight, the uniform is genuine United States [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30] Merchant Marine [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q865132] uniform and the fifth stripe, the purple stripe denotes me as a chief poet, which I was appointed by three captains, two chief engineers and several assorted mates of United States lines and we invented the uniform one night and they threw in all the materials and my wife gave it to me for a Christmas present, so I am responsible for the moral, religious, emotional and sexual life of the crew while at sea. It's a very serious duty! The book that's out now is actually my fourth book of poems, the first to some of you may be familiar with some of the poems from The New American Poetry [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7753501]and so on, The Dutiful Son and The Love Bit. And In Time is the fourth book. The third book is a little known book because Jonathan Williams [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6274797] has been carrying it around in his briefcase for eight years and sends me postcards every six month saying he's bringing it out. I thought maybe since it probably will never get published I should read some poems from there, it's called Friends and Lovers and most of the poems have initialed inscriptions, some of which I will name to you, and some of which somebody going for his Master's thirty years from now will have to do a lot of research to figure out. It's divided into two parts, obviously in the first part is friends and in the second part is lovers. This is the dedicatory poem. \"Orpheus\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q174353].\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:02:52\nReads \"Orpheus\" [published later in Just Friends\/Friends and Lovers].\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:03:20\nThis is a poem called \"Lesson I\" and it's for Charles Olson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q922978]. It's also as sure you all recognize upon a parody on one of Pound's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q163366] Usury Cantos [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2701465] and it's based on an actual softball incident in which Charles was supposed to be coaching third base and instead was discussing Etruscan sculpture when I was rounding second on a long drive to left centre field.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:03:54\nReads \"Lesson I\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:04:30\nCharles got very upset about that. This is a poem for Franz Kline [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q374492]. Do I need to tell you who Franz was? Alright, if anybody doesn't know should ask the person next to them after the reading\u2026\u201dPablo Nerruda--\u201d It\u2019s called \u201cThe Boys Whose Fathers\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:04:57\nReads \"The Boys Whose Fathers\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:08:31\nAnd this is for Cubby Selby [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q551487] who wrote Last Exit to Brooklyn [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1400274]. \u201cA Poem In Tune With Its Time\u201d.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:08:39\nReads \u201cA Poem In Tune With Its Time\u201d.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:09:13\nThis is for Phillip Guston [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q701952]. That's very strange, I find that now I can say the names. Philip is a still surviving member of the New York [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60] Abstract Expressionist school, or whatever they call it these days. And a marvelous painter.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:09:30\nReads \"A Grace for Painters\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:11:21\nThis is another poem for Charles Olson. It's called \"Okay\". This is a funny book because it was written about 1961, as I say literally, it's been carried around in manuscript form for eight years and why I never pulled it back except that those damn postcards kept coming in so I kept saying, okay, six months more and it just was a scene I got into where I, personal poems to people became a thing that I was doing at that time. It's called \"Okay\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:12:10\nReads \"Okay\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:13:54\nThank you. I don't know how many of you knew Charles, that was a visit to New York and we did have a marvelous meal in New York's Chinatown [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q866332] and I just said to the guy, you know, bring us so many dollars worth of food, and there were eleven of us, Ed Dorn [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5334756] and his wife were with us and LeRoi Jones [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q354783] and his wife and Charles, and we sat there and they kept bringing dishes out everybody stuffed themselves and we were all sitting there and Charles, as most of you know was about 6'7\u201d and about 250 pounds and after all this food had come out and been consumed, the guy came out with a sea bass about this big, and everybody sorta looked and Charles said, \"Oh, thank you Joel\" and proceeded to demolish this thing. Well, everybody just sitting...[audience laughter]. Ah, yes! I have a Canadian poem for you. I didn't even know that. This is a poem for Ed Dorn and it's called \"The Fourth Ark Royal\". One night at a bar called Dylan's, Ed and I had seen each other for the first time for about six years and a couple of sailors came in and they had Ark Royal on their caps and Canadian badges and finally after a couple of drinks I asked one of them what the Ark Royal was, and to their shame and my chagrin, and they really were abashed when they said it, it turns out now that the Ark Royal is now a Corvette, uh, after a long distinguished history and not that--I'm sure that it's a great Corvette, but still, a Corvette is a Corvette, you know.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:16:03\nReads \"The Fourth Ark Royal\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:20:03\nDoes anybody know where the Fourth Ark Royal is anchored? I'll go see it tomorrow. I have to make a confession, I pulled a dreadful gaff yesterday and I'm sure that Stan and George are going to spread it around after I leave, so I'm going to confess it in public. I said \"Gee, we're going to be here for a couple of days and there's one thing I'd really like to see. And do you suppose somebody might, you know, give us a lift to the Plains of Abraham [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2726825]\", and they both looked at me and said \"It's 100 miles away in Quebec [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q176]\" and I said \"Oh my god, you're right\" and then I got home, to the hotel, and I was reading through, what's the name of that lovely magazine they give you at the hotel? Canada Today or something, and I was reading through, and when I saw them today, I said \"Oh well, I was wrong about the Plains of Abraham, but we guys captured Montreal once\" and it made me feel much better. Of course, we didn't hold it very long, I think a day we were here. This is a thing called \"Spring Poem\". And let's hope that it gets here.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:21:24\nReads \"Spring Poem\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:21:39\nAhah! Yes, gee, I don't know if you're liking these, but I'm so delighted, I really haven't looked at these poems in moons, and it's...this is a poem for Gil Sorrentino [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q326773] called \"The Aces\", and it starts with a quote from Antony and Cleopatra [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q606830]. And it's when, it's the speech that's always quoted where the death is announced to her, and everybody always quotes the crown he bestride the continents like [unintelligible] and crowns--the crown would drop from his pocket, but I always love the end of it, near the end, she says \"His delights were dolphin-like, they showed his back above the element they lived in\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:22:28\nReads \"The Aces\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:23:36\nFor J.C. Just to add a little mystery.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:23:56\nReads unnamed poem \"There are waterfalls pour straight down\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:24:48\n\"La Revoluci\u00f3n\", for J.S.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:24:51\nReads \"La Revoluci\u00f3n\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:25:55\nI think what I'll do is read one--this is kind of a long poem, are you up to a longish poem and then we'll call a break? \"A Little Mayan Head\", for E.W.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:26:23\nReads \"A Little Mayan Head\".\n\nUnknown\n00:30:22\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:30:23\nIt's titled \"N.B.\", but that isn't for a lady, that's Nota Bene, if I am correcting--if I am pronouncing that correctly, or correcting that pronouncedly.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:30:34\nReads \"N.B.\"\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:31:10\n\"Poem for New Children\", for E. and L.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:31:14\nReads \"Poem for New Children\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:31:35\n\"Peire Vidal at Thirty-Two\" and any of you who don't know Peire Vidal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5269] are instructed to report to George Bowering on Monday morning and he will give you a lecture on Peire Vidal. And George, if you don't have a lecture prepared, you better by then. Peire Vidal was the most marvelous poet in the world, his vida begins, Peire Vidal was the son of a rich fourrier in Toulouse [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7880], he sang better than any man in the world and he wrote good songs and he was the biggest fool the world has ever known because he believed that what a woman told him in love was true. He also [audience laughter] wrote a poem, this will get an even bigger hit when he was an old man he wrote a gorgeous poem that I can't quote, and you can thank me for that, he wrote a gorgeous poem in which in the first stanza, he avowed his eternal love to four different chicks [audience laughter]. \n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:32:4\nReads \"Peire Vidal at Thirty-Two\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:33:16\n\"The Truck Farmer\", for R. F.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:33:25\nReads \"The Truck Farmer\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:35:01\n\"Dutch Interior: Sewing\", also for R.F. R.F. was my first wife.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:35:07\nReads \"Dutch Interior: Sewing\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:35:36\n\"Clams on the Half-Shelf\" for M.M. And I must say I've been very disappointed, because everybody kept telling me what great seafood restaurants Montreal has and the only seafood I can really stand is fresh clams and every restaurant I go into says, \"Oh, yeah, we have oysters but we don't serve clams\". Does anyone know a restaurant where I can get fresh clams?...This is for M.M.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:36:09\nReads \"Clams on the Half-Shelf\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:36:48\nI must confess to the ladies in the audience that my book has been branded by women's lib in New York as insulting to women, and I have great fights with all of them, I praise their bosoms, and they sort of calm down then, but they still keep putting up stickers on my book jackets. It's amazing what you can do to a women's lib chick if you just tell her that she has very nice tits, really. Immediately they desert the movement. \"New Blues for the Moon\" for D.D.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:37:34\nReads \"New Blues for the Moon\" [from In Time: 1962-1968].\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:38:10\nIt took me four years after, I got the rhyme line to \"I know your door better than my own\" but now it's too late to write the blues, but if anybody's interested, it's \"And if you won't have me I still ain't goin' home.\" \"A Love Poem\" for M.S.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:38:33\nReads \"A Love Poem\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:39:08\nOh yeah, that's a nice poem for today. \"Third of April\", for M.R.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:39:16\nReads \"Third of April\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:39:59\n\"A Five Act Play\" for B.J.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:40:02\nReads \"A Five Act Play\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:40:27\n\"Nature Boy\" for B.C. Helen, are you keeping notes on these initials?\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:40:41\nReads \"Nature Boy\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:41:22\n\"Flora\" for J.G.\n \nAnnotation\n00:41:31\nReads \"Flora\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:42:04\nI'm not sure I like this poem but the story behind it is funny. The really, the fairest break-up, for very strange reasons, and this one literally broke up because the first day that the chick made me sunny-side up eggs, she mashed the yolk with her fork. [Audience laughter]. I knew that no matter how beautiful the scene had been I couldn't stay there anymore. It's called \"Purple Flowers\" and it's for S.G., wherever you might be.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:42:54\nReads \"Purple Flowers\" [audience laughter throughout].\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:43:29\n\"The Apples\" for D.R.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:43:35\nReads \"The Apples\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:44:10\nI have--this is the last poem in the book and if you want to hear some stuff from--this is a longish one, why don't we call a stop after this, and if people want to split, split and if people want to stay I'll read a little bit more from the new book. \"When What You Dream\" for F.E.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:44:45\nReads \"When What You Dream\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:51:07\nThis book starts with a poem that was turned down by at least 37 little magazines, and I finally blackjacked it in as the introductory poem. It's called \"The Poem\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:51:36\nReads \"The Poem\" [from In Time: 1962-1968].\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:51:45\nNobody liked it. Dan Rice is the only person in the world I know that likes that poem. And I think it's the best poem I ever wrote. This is a poem for the other poet I have to most love for, Li Po [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7071], the Chinese poet from 700, 800, roughly. It's called \"shooting the moon\". Li Po, his particular distinctions were that he seduced the emperor of China's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q148] favourite courtesan, and showed up two hours late for the date, bombed out of his skull, and fell asleep on her bosom before doing anything, and the emperor was not terribly amused by it but at the same time he was impressed by the enormity of the action so he exiled him to the mountains but he gave him like 50 thousand acres and bread for life, it's just he was not to show up in court ever again. While there, he did several notable things, one of which is writing the best lush poem that's ever been written cause he got up on a beautiful spring day and was sitting out on his terrace and his servant brought him breakfast and he ate it and he started drinking some sake and the next thing he knew it was nine o'clock at night and like he had sorta missed spring so he started drinking again, and the last line of the poem is something like \"two hours later I was dancing with the moon\". So, he worked it out. The only problem was, that he was literally in love with the moon, and this image runs through his poem, and one night on the way home from a wine tavern, he decided finally to make it with the moon and he sat down at the edge of the river, left it under a rock with his clothes and dove in to screw the moon, literally, the reflection in the water, and drowned. And one hopes that--I don't know what the autopsy showed, but one hopes that he did make it before he drowned, you know, like, you have to love, you know, a guy like that.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:54:28\nReads \"Shooting the Moon\" [from In Time: 1962-1968].\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:56:37\nHelen, do you remember, by any chance, where the other moon poem is? Hold on one--I think I have it. Marvelous picture in the Times [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q9684] one day, the first time they took a--the first time one of the things went around the moon, and I wrote a very funny poem about it I think, if I can find it here. Oh well, while I'm looking for it, I'll read you \"Zeus, in May, Reflects on a Recent Letter from Astarte\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:57:53\nReads \"Zeus, in May, Reflects on a Recent Letter from Astarte\" [from In Time: 1962-1968].\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:58:37\nAm I allowed to read dirty poems here? Yeah? This is a poem called \"Poem in Praise of Perseverance\". And anybody who doesn't want to hear it should close their ears. This is another poem that was rejected by about 40 magazines.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:59:05\nReads \"Poem in Praise of Perseverance\" [from In Time: 1962-1968].\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:59:34\nI really do want to find that damn moon poem. Alright, \"The New Standard Simplified American Cabala for Home Use\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:59:53\nReads \"The New Standard Simplified American Cabala for Home Use\" [from In Time: 1962-1968].\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n01:00:12\n\"The Three Old Ladies\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n01:00:24\nReads \"The Three Old Ladies\" [from In Time: 1962-1968].\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n01:01:14\nThat poem incidentally was because of a little incident in a college in Brooklyn [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q18419] because they had a lady faculty member as a cop and she listened to me read and she objected to only one word in the entire reading and that was 'hard-on' and I suggested gently to the woman who called me about it that that might be that lady's problem, if she could listen to my--I found the moon poem, thank god--if that was the only word she found to object to that I really thought she might need a little help somewhere from somebody. \"Wrong Again\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n01:02:11\nReads \"Wrong Again\" [from In Time: 1962-1968; audience laughter throughout].\n \nEND\n01:03:25\n[Cut off abruptly]."

There, he was influenced by Charles Olson and colleagues such as Robert Creeley, Ed Dorn, Jonathan Williams and Fielding Dawson, forming the Black Mountain Poets. Visiting writer William Carlos Williams and e.e. cummings also greatly influenced Oppenheimer. Joel published The Dancer in 1951 (Sad Devil Press at Black Mountain College), The Dutiful Son in 1956 (Short Hills, Johnathan Cape), The Love Bit in 1962 (Totem Press) and Sirventes on a Sad Occasion in 1967 (The Perishable Press) while working in a printing shop. In 1966 he became the director of the Poetry Project at St Mark\u2019s Church in-the-Bowery, a New York City reading series and by 1969, Oppenheimer became a columnist for the Village Voice. He then published In Time: Poems 1962-1968 (Bobbs-Merrill, 1969), and in 1973 published On Occasion: Some Births, Deaths, Weddings, Birthdays, Holidays, and Other Events, a book of occasional poems (Bobbs-Merrill). The Woman Poems (Bobbs-Merrill) was published in 1975, and Names, Dates & Places (Saint Andrew\u2019s Press, 1973) chronicled the New York Mets. He also wrote a popular book about Marilyn Monroe, called Marilyn Lives! (Delilah, 1981). In 1984 Oppenheimer taught creative writing at New England College in Henniker, New Hampshire. His last published book of poetry was New Spaces: Poems 1975-1983 (Black Sparrow Press, 1985). Joel Oppenheimer died of lung cancer on October 11, 1988."

I happen to be the finest softball pitcher Black Mountain ever had. And so that none of you lose any sleep tonight, the uniform is genuine United States [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30] Merchant Marine [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q865132] uniform and the fifth stripe, the purple stripe denotes me as a chief poet, which I was appointed by three captains, two chief engineers and several assorted mates of United States lines and we invented the uniform one night and they threw in all the materials and my wife gave it to me for a Christmas present, so I am responsible for the moral, religious, emotional and sexual life of the crew while at sea. It's a very serious duty! The book that's out now is actually my fourth book of poems, the first to some of you may be familiar with some of the poems from The New American Poetry [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7753501]and so on, The Dutiful Son and The Love Bit. And In Time is the fourth book. The third book is a little known book because Jonathan Williams [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6274797] has been carrying it around in his briefcase for eight years and sends me postcards every six month saying he's bringing it out. I thought maybe since it probably will never get published I should read some poems from there, it's called Friends and Lovers and most of the poems have initialed inscriptions, some of which I will name to you, and some of which somebody going for his Master's thirty years from now will have to do a lot of research to figure out. It's divided into two parts, obviously in the first part is friends and in the second part is lovers. This is the dedicatory poem. \"Orpheus\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q174353].\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:02:52\nReads \"Orpheus\" [published later in Just Friends\/Friends and Lovers].\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:03:20\nThis is a poem called \"Lesson I\" and it's for Charles Olson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q922978]. It's also as sure you all recognize upon a parody on one of Pound's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q163366] Usury Cantos [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2701465] and it's based on an actual softball incident in which Charles was supposed to be coaching third base and instead was discussing Etruscan sculpture when I was rounding second on a long drive to left centre field.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:03:54\nReads \"Lesson I\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:04:30\nCharles got very upset about that. This is a poem for Franz Kline [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q374492]. Do I need to tell you who Franz was? Alright, if anybody doesn't know should ask the person next to them after the reading\u2026\u201dPablo Nerruda--\u201d It\u2019s called \u201cThe Boys Whose Fathers\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:04:57\nReads \"The Boys Whose Fathers\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:08:31\nAnd this is for Cubby Selby [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q551487] who wrote Last Exit to Brooklyn [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1400274]. \u201cA Poem In Tune With Its Time\u201d.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:08:39\nReads \u201cA Poem In Tune With Its Time\u201d.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:09:13\nThis is for Phillip Guston [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q701952]. That's very strange, I find that now I can say the names. Philip is a still surviving member of the New York [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60] Abstract Expressionist school, or whatever they call it these days. And a marvelous painter.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:09:30\nReads \"A Grace for Painters\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:11:21\nThis is another poem for Charles Olson. It's called \"Okay\". This is a funny book because it was written about 1961, as I say literally, it's been carried around in manuscript form for eight years and why I never pulled it back except that those damn postcards kept coming in so I kept saying, okay, six months more and it just was a scene I got into where I, personal poems to people became a thing that I was doing at that time. It's called \"Okay\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:12:10\nReads \"Okay\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:13:54\nThank you. I don't know how many of you knew Charles, that was a visit to New York and we did have a marvelous meal in New York's Chinatown [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q866332] and I just said to the guy, you know, bring us so many dollars worth of food, and there were eleven of us, Ed Dorn [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5334756] and his wife were with us and LeRoi Jones [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q354783] and his wife and Charles, and we sat there and they kept bringing dishes out everybody stuffed themselves and we were all sitting there and Charles, as most of you know was about 6'7\u201d and about 250 pounds and after all this food had come out and been consumed, the guy came out with a sea bass about this big, and everybody sorta looked and Charles said, \"Oh, thank you Joel\" and proceeded to demolish this thing. Well, everybody just sitting...[audience laughter]. Ah, yes! I have a Canadian poem for you. I didn't even know that. This is a poem for Ed Dorn and it's called \"The Fourth Ark Royal\". One night at a bar called Dylan's, Ed and I had seen each other for the first time for about six years and a couple of sailors came in and they had Ark Royal on their caps and Canadian badges and finally after a couple of drinks I asked one of them what the Ark Royal was, and to their shame and my chagrin, and they really were abashed when they said it, it turns out now that the Ark Royal is now a Corvette, uh, after a long distinguished history and not that--I'm sure that it's a great Corvette, but still, a Corvette is a Corvette, you know.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:16:03\nReads \"The Fourth Ark Royal\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:20:03\nDoes anybody know where the Fourth Ark Royal is anchored? I'll go see it tomorrow. I have to make a confession, I pulled a dreadful gaff yesterday and I'm sure that Stan and George are going to spread it around after I leave, so I'm going to confess it in public. I said \"Gee, we're going to be here for a couple of days and there's one thing I'd really like to see. And do you suppose somebody might, you know, give us a lift to the Plains of Abraham [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2726825]\", and they both looked at me and said \"It's 100 miles away in Quebec [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q176]\" and I said \"Oh my god, you're right\" and then I got home, to the hotel, and I was reading through, what's the name of that lovely magazine they give you at the hotel? Canada Today or something, and I was reading through, and when I saw them today, I said \"Oh well, I was wrong about the Plains of Abraham, but we guys captured Montreal once\" and it made me feel much better. Of course, we didn't hold it very long, I think a day we were here. This is a thing called \"Spring Poem\". And let's hope that it gets here.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:21:24\nReads \"Spring Poem\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:21:39\nAhah! Yes, gee, I don't know if you're liking these, but I'm so delighted, I really haven't looked at these poems in moons, and it's...this is a poem for Gil Sorrentino [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q326773] called \"The Aces\", and it starts with a quote from Antony and Cleopatra [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q606830]. And it's when, it's the speech that's always quoted where the death is announced to her, and everybody always quotes the crown he bestride the continents like [unintelligible] and crowns--the crown would drop from his pocket, but I always love the end of it, near the end, she says \"His delights were dolphin-like, they showed his back above the element they lived in\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:22:28\nReads \"The Aces\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:23:36\nFor J.C. Just to add a little mystery.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:23:56\nReads unnamed poem \"There are waterfalls pour straight down\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:24:48\n\"La Revoluci\u00f3n\", for J.S.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:24:51\nReads \"La Revoluci\u00f3n\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:25:55\nI think what I'll do is read one--this is kind of a long poem, are you up to a longish poem and then we'll call a break? \"A Little Mayan Head\", for E.W.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:26:23\nReads \"A Little Mayan Head\".\n\nUnknown\n00:30:22\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:30:23\nIt's titled \"N.B.\", but that isn't for a lady, that's Nota Bene, if I am correcting--if I am pronouncing that correctly, or correcting that pronouncedly.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:30:34\nReads \"N.B.\"\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:31:10\n\"Poem for New Children\", for E. and L.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:31:14\nReads \"Poem for New Children\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:31:35\n\"Peire Vidal at Thirty-Two\" and any of you who don't know Peire Vidal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5269] are instructed to report to George Bowering on Monday morning and he will give you a lecture on Peire Vidal. And George, if you don't have a lecture prepared, you better by then. Peire Vidal was the most marvelous poet in the world, his vida begins, Peire Vidal was the son of a rich fourrier in Toulouse [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7880], he sang better than any man in the world and he wrote good songs and he was the biggest fool the world has ever known because he believed that what a woman told him in love was true. He also [audience laughter] wrote a poem, this will get an even bigger hit when he was an old man he wrote a gorgeous poem that I can't quote, and you can thank me for that, he wrote a gorgeous poem in which in the first stanza, he avowed his eternal love to four different chicks [audience laughter]. \n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:32:4\nReads \"Peire Vidal at Thirty-Two\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:33:16\n\"The Truck Farmer\", for R. F.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:33:25\nReads \"The Truck Farmer\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:35:01\n\"Dutch Interior: Sewing\", also for R.F. R.F. was my first wife.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:35:07\nReads \"Dutch Interior: Sewing\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:35:36\n\"Clams on the Half-Shelf\" for M.M. And I must say I've been very disappointed, because everybody kept telling me what great seafood restaurants Montreal has and the only seafood I can really stand is fresh clams and every restaurant I go into says, \"Oh, yeah, we have oysters but we don't serve clams\". Does anyone know a restaurant where I can get fresh clams?...This is for M.M.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:36:09\nReads \"Clams on the Half-Shelf\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:36:48\nI must confess to the ladies in the audience that my book has been branded by women's lib in New York as insulting to women, and I have great fights with all of them, I praise their bosoms, and they sort of calm down then, but they still keep putting up stickers on my book jackets. It's amazing what you can do to a women's lib chick if you just tell her that she has very nice tits, really. Immediately they desert the movement. \"New Blues for the Moon\" for D.D.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:37:34\nReads \"New Blues for the Moon\" [from In Time: 1962-1968].\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:38:10\nIt took me four years after, I got the rhyme line to \"I know your door better than my own\" but now it's too late to write the blues, but if anybody's interested, it's \"And if you won't have me I still ain't goin' home.\" \"A Love Poem\" for M.S.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:38:33\nReads \"A Love Poem\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:39:08\nOh yeah, that's a nice poem for today. \"Third of April\", for M.R.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:39:16\nReads \"Third of April\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:39:59\n\"A Five Act Play\" for B.J.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:40:02\nReads \"A Five Act Play\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:40:27\n\"Nature Boy\" for B.C. Helen, are you keeping notes on these initials?\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:40:41\nReads \"Nature Boy\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:41:22\n\"Flora\" for J.G.\n \nAnnotation\n00:41:31\nReads \"Flora\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:42:04\nI'm not sure I like this poem but the story behind it is funny. The really, the fairest break-up, for very strange reasons, and this one literally broke up because the first day that the chick made me sunny-side up eggs, she mashed the yolk with her fork. [Audience laughter]. I knew that no matter how beautiful the scene had been I couldn't stay there anymore. It's called \"Purple Flowers\" and it's for S.G., wherever you might be.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:42:54\nReads \"Purple Flowers\" [audience laughter throughout].\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:43:29\n\"The Apples\" for D.R.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:43:35\nReads \"The Apples\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:44:10\nI have--this is the last poem in the book and if you want to hear some stuff from--this is a longish one, why don't we call a stop after this, and if people want to split, split and if people want to stay I'll read a little bit more from the new book. \"When What You Dream\" for F.E.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:44:45\nReads \"When What You Dream\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:51:07\nThis book starts with a poem that was turned down by at least 37 little magazines, and I finally blackjacked it in as the introductory poem. It's called \"The Poem\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:51:36\nReads \"The Poem\" [from In Time: 1962-1968].\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:51:45\nNobody liked it. Dan Rice is the only person in the world I know that likes that poem. And I think it's the best poem I ever wrote. This is a poem for the other poet I have to most love for, Li Po [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7071], the Chinese poet from 700, 800, roughly. It's called \"shooting the moon\". Li Po, his particular distinctions were that he seduced the emperor of China's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q148] favourite courtesan, and showed up two hours late for the date, bombed out of his skull, and fell asleep on her bosom before doing anything, and the emperor was not terribly amused by it but at the same time he was impressed by the enormity of the action so he exiled him to the mountains but he gave him like 50 thousand acres and bread for life, it's just he was not to show up in court ever again. While there, he did several notable things, one of which is writing the best lush poem that's ever been written cause he got up on a beautiful spring day and was sitting out on his terrace and his servant brought him breakfast and he ate it and he started drinking some sake and the next thing he knew it was nine o'clock at night and like he had sorta missed spring so he started drinking again, and the last line of the poem is something like \"two hours later I was dancing with the moon\". So, he worked it out. The only problem was, that he was literally in love with the moon, and this image runs through his poem, and one night on the way home from a wine tavern, he decided finally to make it with the moon and he sat down at the edge of the river, left it under a rock with his clothes and dove in to screw the moon, literally, the reflection in the water, and drowned. And one hopes that--I don't know what the autopsy showed, but one hopes that he did make it before he drowned, you know, like, you have to love, you know, a guy like that.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:54:28\nReads \"Shooting the Moon\" [from In Time: 1962-1968].\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:56:37\nHelen, do you remember, by any chance, where the other moon poem is? Hold on one--I think I have it. Marvelous picture in the Times [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q9684] one day, the first time they took a--the first time one of the things went around the moon, and I wrote a very funny poem about it I think, if I can find it here. Oh well, while I'm looking for it, I'll read you \"Zeus, in May, Reflects on a Recent Letter from Astarte\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:57:53\nReads \"Zeus, in May, Reflects on a Recent Letter from Astarte\" [from In Time: 1962-1968].\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:58:37\nAm I allowed to read dirty poems here? Yeah? This is a poem called \"Poem in Praise of Perseverance\". And anybody who doesn't want to hear it should close their ears. This is another poem that was rejected by about 40 magazines.\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:59:05\nReads \"Poem in Praise of Perseverance\" [from In Time: 1962-1968].\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:59:34\nI really do want to find that damn moon poem. Alright, \"The New Standard Simplified American Cabala for Home Use\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n00:59:53\nReads \"The New Standard Simplified American Cabala for Home Use\" [from In Time: 1962-1968].\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n01:00:12\n\"The Three Old Ladies\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n01:00:24\nReads \"The Three Old Ladies\" [from In Time: 1962-1968].\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n01:01:14\nThat poem incidentally was because of a little incident in a college in Brooklyn [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q18419] because they had a lady faculty member as a cop and she listened to me read and she objected to only one word in the entire reading and that was 'hard-on' and I suggested gently to the woman who called me about it that that might be that lady's problem, if she could listen to my--I found the moon poem, thank god--if that was the only word she found to object to that I really thought she might need a little help somewhere from somebody. \"Wrong Again\".\n \nJoel Oppenheimer\n01:02:11\nReads \"Wrong Again\" [from In Time: 1962-1968; audience laughter throughout].\n \nEND\n01:03:25\n[Cut off abruptly].",

            "contents": "daphne_marlatt_i086-11-035.mp3\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:00:00\nI thought that what I'd do first is read to you from the Vancouver Poems, which won't be published with a 'the', I hope. I guess I'll just try and explain allusions as I go along for those people who have never been to Vancouver [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q24639] or know it because the poems tend to be pretty local, as they were intended to be, and I'll read you two quotes that I have at the beginning because they might help to explain certain concerns in the poem. The first one's from Rimbaud [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q493], it's from a letter of his in which he was talking about his new conception of the poet and how the poet writes, and he said simply \"Je est une autre.\" The second quote is from a record recently released by Randy Newman [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q318475], this is from one of his songs: \"She say I talk to strangers if I want to, 'coz I'm a stranger too\". These are all prose poems. Lagoon is Lost Lagoon, it's supposed to be lost because it was cut off from the sea by man-made walk, and there's a sort of local myth among the kids growing up there that Lost Lagoon is lost too, because it has no bottom, nobody has ever found the bottom. \"Lagoon\".\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:01:42\nReads \"Lagoon\" [published later in Vancouver Poems].\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:03:40\nThe first poem in the book is sort of a, an entranceway to the book as a whole, it in some ways it sets up my method, I originally had, I'd been reading a lot about Japanese Noh plays, and I'd especially been interested in the Spirit Plays and my original figure in here was a Shite, who is the doer, the central figure in the Noh, who performs the dance and who the particular Noh is about. He usually first appears in the spirit plays as an old man, an old fisherman, or salt-gatherer, some kind of beat down, destitute person, an anonymous person, and the Waki comes along and somehow starts up a conversation and begins to wonder about this man, and usually asks him to tell him the story of the place where he is, assuming that this is some sort of historical shrine, which it often is, and the Waki has come specifically to see this place and as the old man begins to tell the story, he, well, there's actually a scene change, an act change, he reappears in all his glory as the original person whose life was lived out, usually tragically and very dramatically, often in a battle, who died in this place and whose spirit consequently haunts the area. Then I started reading about the Kwakiutl who are a tribe of the Indians somewhat to the north of Vancouver, about the furthest south they reach is the Campbell River [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q270481] on Vancouver Island [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q170479] which is, I don't know how many miles north of Vancouver, 100? 80, about 80. But I always figured that there must have been some sort of interchange between the Kwakiutl and the Salish, the particular tribe around the Fraser Delta [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q269710]  in Vancouver. The thing that interested me the most about the Kwakiutl were one particular secret society called the \"Hamatsa\" and in the Hamatsa it writes, one goes into a sort of frenzy and is possessed by the original spirit, who then passed on the rituals, and the frenzy denotes the acquirement of a certain kind of power. I guess the Salish have something a little corresponding to that in that they have, I don't know what you call them, they're certain kinds of dances which are meant to perform the meeting between the individual who dances, the initiate, and the spirit of the particular place whom he encounters and who gives them, in result of this dance, particular powers. \"Wet fur wavers\", this is a Spanish Banks [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7573148] poem, about a walk, a Sunday walk along the Spanish Banks.\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:06:56\nReads \"Wet fur wavers\" [published later in Vancouver Poems].\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:08:16.15\nAnd straight from that to another one that's somewhat linked up to that in terms of its content. This is about the public library, the old Carnegie Library [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1376408], which is, has since been closed down because the library rebuilt in an up-town area, the old Carnegie Library is located in the heart of skid row and used to be frequented mainly by old men reading who were reading newspapers who were trying to escape from the eternal rain and the cold.\n\nDaphne Marlatt\n00:08:54\nReads \"Go on\".\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:10:34\nThe next one which is also linked, I should have mentioned before the last one that the White Lunch--it must be a Vancouver phenomenon because I don't think I've seen it anywhere else. It's a chain of self-serve cafes, restaurants, and they're inexpensive of course, and their symbol outside is a huge white teacup and saucer, with these little coloured stooped figures running, eternally running around the saucer. This next poem is about a woman whose name I didn't know, I attributed a name to her, Emma. She could be seen, often around Berrard and Granville streets, and instead of going into the White Lunch, she used to go into the Bay, Hudson's Bay [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q641129], and sit on the benches outside the elevator, and wait to warm up, I guess. Often, she seemed to me to be just to be interested in watching the weird kind of people who used to shop at the Bay, all those people with money. \"Razor Back Woman\" is taken from a John Stewart [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1393453] album, lyric of his.\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:12:05\nReads \"razorbackt woman\".\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:13:56\nOne last one that connects with the Kwakiutl Hamatsa society, this is going to need some explanation. Baxbakwalanuksiwe\u2019, is--and I'm not responsible for my pronunciation for any people here who know how Kwakiutl sounds, because I don't--I'm just picking it up from various spellings and he was the original spirit who informed the Hamatsas, who gave them their cannibal right because an Indian managed to overcome him, through a trick.\n\nAudience Member 1\n00:14:48\nWhich one is that? Which name?\n\nDaphne Marlatt\n00:14:50\nHamatsa--Baxbakwalanuksiwe\u2019. He was supposed to have been the first man, the first one to eat man at the mouth of the river, that's a quote. He was a sort of bird-like, obviously inhuman creature whose body was covered all over with mouths and he used to have various attendants around, and one of whom was a woman who was rooted to the floor of his cabin and she was very beautiful, and she used to lure people in who then became his victims. But in this particular occasion, these three Indian brothers somehow won her sympathy or something, but she told them, Baxbakwalanuksiwe\u2019 was out at the moment, she told him that he would be expected back and that they were supposed to be his victims, and that the only way to overcome this was to build, to dig a deep pit in the floor, cover it over with boughs and then and have a trap that he could spring, that could release the boughs, and then when he did his dance, prior to killing and eating his victims, they would just pull the string or whatever it was and he would then fall into the pit. And then they could set fire to him. Qominaga is the woman, and I don't know if I should explain the B.C. [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1974] liquor laws or not. [Audience laughter]. Well, for those of you who don't know B.C., up until not so very long ago, what, five? No, must be longer than that, maybe ten years, the beer parlors used to be segregated, and men, alone, sat on one side, and women, alone, and women would be the escorts sat on the other side and you had to enter the beer parlor from different doors, one of which was marked \"Men\", and the other was \"Ladies and Escorts\". The men's side also used to have, in some of the beer parlors, used to have a wooden floor covered with sawdust, which was simply easier to keep clean because of course when expected, there were constant brawls on the men's side and a lot of broken glass and spilled beer, I suppose that was the rationale. This is dedicated to the Alcazar, Cecil, Belmont, [New Fountain (?)] [audience laughter].\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:17:33\nReads unnamed poem  \u201cnames stations of the way to\".\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:20:33\nLittle poems, for my niece who has, or had, she's probably over it by now, a thing about bugs. That bugs are horrible--any bug, no matter what. So I wrote these four poems to try and explain to her what it was like to be a bug, although it's very human, called \"Bugs in the Heart\", for Karen.\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:20:57\nReads \"Bugs in the Heart\" [published later in What Matters: Writing 1968-1970].\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:22:00\nThese are all fairly recent poems. \"Agenda\".\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:22:06\nReads \"Agenda\".\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:22:24\nLast Easter, we were in [Tousse (?)], took our swimsuits, expected to come back with a tan. Snowed every night, it was beautiful in the morning. \n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:22:37\nReads unnamed poem. \"Points west, or south-west, wet downpour...\"\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:23:00\nWe're living on a farm and this is a poem, for practically the first time in our lives, this is a poem that I wrote last year, Phil's our landlord and he's always coming up with useful bits of information about, speaking of David, books, about what birds are what.\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:23:29\nReads unnamed poem. \"Depressed area space, lived in...\".\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:24:42\nThis is a poem that I wrote when I was about, oh I don't know, seven or eight months pregnant. \"Bird of Passage\", I wrote it in Vancouver. Spring time again.\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:25:02\nReads \"Bird of Passage\" [published later in What Matters: Writing 1968-1970]. \n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:27:38\nOne of the in fact, the original Vancouver poem which was written in Bloomington [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q490385], Indiana [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1415], probably out of a sense of nostalgia, it's about the man who used to collect the rents on the house that I lived in on Comox Street, and he had a little room up in the attic and he was kind of old, he was also the man who I met at the door when I first came to inquire about their rooms.\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:28:09\nReads unnamed poem. \"Old Bird, he...\"\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:29:31\nAbout Vancouver's fire, in 1868? 1886. There are a lot of quotes in here, and I think all of them, yes all of them are taken from a historical journal put out by the city archives and the body of it is concerned with W.H. Gallagher's eye-witness account. He was in a little office and had control of payroll for men who were working for the CPR clearing the land, the fire was caused by the clearing of the land, because the trees were knocked down bowling-pin method, that is a tree, a very large tree was chosen and then cut so that it would bring down a pile of trees as it fell and then the stuff was left because they didn't get around to burning it. And it was left over the summer, and got as dry as tinder. Not only that, but they were using gunpowder to blow up stumps. \n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:30:46\nReads \"Our city is ashes\".\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:33:45\nThis is \"Bowen Island\".\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:33:50\nReads \"Bowen Island\" [published later as \u201cBowen\u201d in Vancouver Poems].\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:35:48\nI know that there was a bridge in Vancouver with a jack-knife span that opened like London Bridge [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q130206]. And I asked everyone I knew\u2026What?\n\nAudience Member 2\n00:36:03\nMarple.\nDaphne Marlatt\n00:36:04\nMarple! Was that Marple? Because no one seemed to know, I even went down to the library to ask them. Well, I've got a footnote in my book that it wasn't true. So anyway, it began to be confused in my mind with the old Second Narrows Bridge [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q643658], which at that time was being torn down. And so it's compounded with memories of old Second Narrows Bridge, which has a lift-span that rises and all kinds of warning signs--it used to be that when you were learning to drive you went down to Second Narrows Bridge and boy if you made that bridge, you could pass the test.\n\nDaphne Marlatt\n00:36:41\nReads \"Your\".\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:39:15\nThis is also a skid row poem, it's a combination of present and past, Water Street, which is a block below Cordova, where there used to be a couple of very popular beer parlours, before they were closed down, Water, the other side of Water, used to be the shore line, that is, the harbour came right up to Water street, and houses, the first houses were built on the southern side of Water. That's where Gassy Jack Deighton [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q720322] built his saloon, the first saloon in Vancouver. That's how Vancouver got its original name, Gastown [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1495636], because this man was an eternal talker apparently. I use a word that's very foreign to me here, Leman, which means like his woman, and is a word that Alan Morley uses in his book about Vancouver and which I think captures the feeling of Gastown with all its small town morality and prudery. \n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:40:32\nReads \"Trails\".\n \nEND\n00:42:24\n"

                "contents": "Daphne Marlatt\n00:00:00\nI thought that what I'd do first is read to you from the Vancouver Poems, which won't be published with a 'the', I hope. I guess I'll just try and explain allusions as I go along for those people who have never been to Vancouver [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q24639] or know it because the poems tend to be pretty local, as they were intended to be, and I'll read you two quotes that I have at the beginning because they might help to explain certain concerns in the poem. The first one's from Rimbaud [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q493], it's from a letter of his in which he was talking about his new conception of the poet and how the poet writes, and he said simply \"Je est une autre.\" The second quote is from a record recently released by Randy Newman [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q318475], this is from one of his songs: \"She say I talk to strangers if I want to, 'coz I'm a stranger too\". These are all prose poems. Lagoon is Lost Lagoon, it's supposed to be lost because it was cut off from the sea by man-made walk, and there's a sort of local myth among the kids growing up there that Lost Lagoon is lost too, because it has no bottom, nobody has ever found the bottom. \"Lagoon\".\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:01:42\nReads \"Lagoon\" [published later in Vancouver Poems].\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:03:40\nThe first poem in the book is sort of a, an entranceway to the book as a whole, it in some ways it sets up my method, I originally had, I'd been reading a lot about Japanese Noh plays, and I'd especially been interested in the Spirit Plays and my original figure in here was a Shite, who is the doer, the central figure in the Noh, who performs the dance and who the particular Noh is about. He usually first appears in the spirit plays as an old man, an old fisherman, or salt-gatherer, some kind of beat down, destitute person, an anonymous person, and the Waki comes along and somehow starts up a conversation and begins to wonder about this man, and usually asks him to tell him the story of the place where he is, assuming that this is some sort of historical shrine, which it often is, and the Waki has come specifically to see this place and as the old man begins to tell the story, he, well, there's actually a scene change, an act change, he reappears in all his glory as the original person whose life was lived out, usually tragically and very dramatically, often in a battle, who died in this place and whose spirit consequently haunts the area. Then I started reading about the Kwakiutl who are a tribe of the Indians somewhat to the north of Vancouver, about the furthest south they reach is the Campbell River [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q270481] on Vancouver Island [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q170479] which is, I don't know how many miles north of Vancouver, 100? 80, about 80. But I always figured that there must have been some sort of interchange between the Kwakiutl and the Salish, the particular tribe around the Fraser Delta [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q269710]  in Vancouver. The thing that interested me the most about the Kwakiutl were one particular secret society called the \"Hamatsa\" and in the Hamatsa it writes, one goes into a sort of frenzy and is possessed by the original spirit, who then passed on the rituals, and the frenzy denotes the acquirement of a certain kind of power. I guess the Salish have something a little corresponding to that in that they have, I don't know what you call them, they're certain kinds of dances which are meant to perform the meeting between the individual who dances, the initiate, and the spirit of the particular place whom he encounters and who gives them, in result of this dance, particular powers. \"Wet fur wavers\", this is a Spanish Banks [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7573148] poem, about a walk, a Sunday walk along the Spanish Banks.\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:06:56\nReads \"Wet fur wavers\" [published later in Vancouver Poems].\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:08:16.15\nAnd straight from that to another one that's somewhat linked up to that in terms of its content. This is about the public library, the old Carnegie Library [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1376408], which is, has since been closed down because the library rebuilt in an up-town area, the old Carnegie Library is located in the heart of skid row and used to be frequented mainly by old men reading who were reading newspapers who were trying to escape from the eternal rain and the cold.\n\nDaphne Marlatt\n00:08:54\nReads \"Go on\".\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:10:34\nThe next one which is also linked, I should have mentioned before the last one that the White Lunch--it must be a Vancouver phenomenon because I don't think I've seen it anywhere else. It's a chain of self-serve cafes, restaurants, and they're inexpensive of course, and their symbol outside is a huge white teacup and saucer, with these little coloured stooped figures running, eternally running around the saucer. This next poem is about a woman whose name I didn't know, I attributed a name to her, Emma. She could be seen, often around Berrard and Granville streets, and instead of going into the White Lunch, she used to go into the Bay, Hudson's Bay [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q641129], and sit on the benches outside the elevator, and wait to warm up, I guess. Often, she seemed to me to be just to be interested in watching the weird kind of people who used to shop at the Bay, all those people with money. \"Razor Back Woman\" is taken from a John Stewart [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1393453] album, lyric of his.\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:12:05\nReads \"razorbackt woman\".\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:13:56\nOne last one that connects with the Kwakiutl Hamatsa society, this is going to need some explanation. Baxbakwalanuksiwe\u2019, is--and I'm not responsible for my pronunciation for any people here who know how Kwakiutl sounds, because I don't--I'm just picking it up from various spellings and he was the original spirit who informed the Hamatsas, who gave them their cannibal right because an Indian managed to overcome him, through a trick.\n\nAudience Member 1\n00:14:48\nWhich one is that? Which name?\n\nDaphne Marlatt\n00:14:50\nHamatsa--Baxbakwalanuksiwe\u2019. He was supposed to have been the first man, the first one to eat man at the mouth of the river, that's a quote. He was a sort of bird-like, obviously inhuman creature whose body was covered all over with mouths and he used to have various attendants around, and one of whom was a woman who was rooted to the floor of his cabin and she was very beautiful, and she used to lure people in who then became his victims. But in this particular occasion, these three Indian brothers somehow won her sympathy or something, but she told them, Baxbakwalanuksiwe\u2019 was out at the moment, she told him that he would be expected back and that they were supposed to be his victims, and that the only way to overcome this was to build, to dig a deep pit in the floor, cover it over with boughs and then and have a trap that he could spring, that could release the boughs, and then when he did his dance, prior to killing and eating his victims, they would just pull the string or whatever it was and he would then fall into the pit. And then they could set fire to him. Qominaga is the woman, and I don't know if I should explain the B.C. [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1974] liquor laws or not. [Audience laughter]. Well, for those of you who don't know B.C., up until not so very long ago, what, five? No, must be longer than that, maybe ten years, the beer parlors used to be segregated, and men, alone, sat on one side, and women, alone, and women would be the escorts sat on the other side and you had to enter the beer parlor from different doors, one of which was marked \"Men\", and the other was \"Ladies and Escorts\". The men's side also used to have, in some of the beer parlors, used to have a wooden floor covered with sawdust, which was simply easier to keep clean because of course when expected, there were constant brawls on the men's side and a lot of broken glass and spilled beer, I suppose that was the rationale. This is dedicated to the Alcazar, Cecil, Belmont, [New Fountain (?)] [audience laughter].\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:17:33\nReads unnamed poem  \u201cnames stations of the way to\".\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:20:33\nLittle poems, for my niece who has, or had, she's probably over it by now, a thing about bugs. That bugs are horrible--any bug, no matter what. So I wrote these four poems to try and explain to her what it was like to be a bug, although it's very human, called \"Bugs in the Heart\", for Karen.\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:20:57\nReads \"Bugs in the Heart\" [published later in What Matters: Writing 1968-1970].\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:22:00\nThese are all fairly recent poems. \"Agenda\".\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:22:06\nReads \"Agenda\".\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:22:24\nLast Easter, we were in [Tousse (?)], took our swimsuits, expected to come back with a tan. Snowed every night, it was beautiful in the morning. \n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:22:37\nReads unnamed poem. \"Points west, or south-west, wet downpour...\"\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:23:00\nWe're living on a farm and this is a poem, for practically the first time in our lives, this is a poem that I wrote last year, Phil's our landlord and he's always coming up with useful bits of information about, speaking of David, books, about what birds are what.\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:23:29\nReads unnamed poem. \"Depressed area space, lived in...\".\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:24:42\nThis is a poem that I wrote when I was about, oh I don't know, seven or eight months pregnant. \"Bird of Passage\", I wrote it in Vancouver. Spring time again.\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:25:02\nReads \"Bird of Passage\" [published later in What Matters: Writing 1968-1970]. \n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:27:38\nOne of the in fact, the original Vancouver poem which was written in Bloomington [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q490385], Indiana [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1415], probably out of a sense of nostalgia, it's about the man who used to collect the rents on the house that I lived in on Comox Street, and he had a little room up in the attic and he was kind of old, he was also the man who I met at the door when I first came to inquire about their rooms.\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:28:09\nReads unnamed poem. \"Old Bird, he...\"\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:29:31\nAbout Vancouver's fire, in 1868? 1886. There are a lot of quotes in here, and I think all of them, yes all of them are taken from a historical journal put out by the city archives and the body of it is concerned with W.H. Gallagher's eye-witness account. He was in a little office and had control of payroll for men who were working for the CPR clearing the land, the fire was caused by the clearing of the land, because the trees were knocked down bowling-pin method, that is a tree, a very large tree was chosen and then cut so that it would bring down a pile of trees as it fell and then the stuff was left because they didn't get around to burning it. And it was left over the summer, and got as dry as tinder. Not only that, but they were using gunpowder to blow up stumps. \n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:30:46\nReads \"Our city is ashes\".\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:33:45\nThis is \"Bowen Island\".\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:33:50\nReads \"Bowen Island\" [published later as \u201cBowen\u201d in Vancouver Poems].\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:35:48\nI know that there was a bridge in Vancouver with a jack-knife span that opened like London Bridge [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q130206]. And I asked everyone I knew\u2026What?\n\nAudience Member 2\n00:36:03\nMarple.\nDaphne Marlatt\n00:36:04\nMarple! Was that Marple? Because no one seemed to know, I even went down to the library to ask them. Well, I've got a footnote in my book that it wasn't true. So anyway, it began to be confused in my mind with the old Second Narrows Bridge [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q643658], which at that time was being torn down. And so it's compounded with memories of old Second Narrows Bridge, which has a lift-span that rises and all kinds of warning signs--it used to be that when you were learning to drive you went down to Second Narrows Bridge and boy if you made that bridge, you could pass the test.\n\nDaphne Marlatt\n00:36:41\nReads \"Your\".\n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:39:15\nThis is also a skid row poem, it's a combination of present and past, Water Street, which is a block below Cordova, where there used to be a couple of very popular beer parlours, before they were closed down, Water, the other side of Water, used to be the shore line, that is, the harbour came right up to Water street, and houses, the first houses were built on the southern side of Water. That's where Gassy Jack Deighton [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q720322] built his saloon, the first saloon in Vancouver. That's how Vancouver got its original name, Gastown [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1495636], because this man was an eternal talker apparently. I use a word that's very foreign to me here, Leman, which means like his woman, and is a word that Alan Morley uses in his book about Vancouver and which I think captures the feeling of Gastown with all its small town morality and prudery. \n \nDaphne Marlatt\n00:40:32\nReads \"Trails\".\n \nEND\n00:42:24\n",

As you probably know, the series that we have, it might be loosely called a kind of an avant-garde series, and in the, this is our fifth year, and this is the first time we've ever had anybody from the New York School [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1972942]--it's not going to be the last time, we're going to have Kenneth Koch [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2708628] in the spring, and we're looking for Tom Clarke [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7815337] next fall. Berrigan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2399732] is I guess now, one of the, say the halfback, I supposed, or quarterback of the New York School. Many of you have probably seen...[laughter] yeah, linebacker! When you ask when you're a little thin... And most of you have probably seen the propaganda sheet that's been around, downstairs and so on, and so you've heard the words that some of his confreres have said about him. I'd just like to add a little bit, in addition to those earlier books such as The Sonnets, and Bean Spasms, there's a couple of new books that have just appeared, one's called In the Early Morning Rain, which will be available here because it's a Cape Goliard book, and it's distributed in Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16] by one of the big Toronto [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q172] publishers, and another one with a Kraut title that I can't read that's bilingual, half-German and half-English that I'm sure we'll hear some from....\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:01:31\nThe title's [unintelligible] Guillaume Apollinaire [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q133855] ist ...\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:01:34\nOh I see, yeah right.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:01:35\nHowever I don't have any available, only in Berlin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q64].\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:01:38\nRight, so if you happen to be in Berlin, snap up a copy of Guillaume Apollinaire ist tot und Anders. So I'd like to mention that Ted Berrigan is going to read one set, and then he wants to stop for a very short intermission, say like a five-minute intermission, and then haul you back in again and do a second set. So ladies and gentlemen, etcetera, Ted Berrigan.\n \nAudience\n00:02:05\nApplause. \n \nUnknown\n00:02:07\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed]. \n \nTed Berrigan\n00:02:08\nIn the first set I'm going to read mostly poems I've written over the last four or five years. Actually, longer than that, some going back to 1962, or '61. I don't know how long this set'll be. It'll, should be less than a half-hour. In the second set I'll read poems I've written over the last year or two. However I want to start with a poem that I wrote about two years ago. It's called \"Heroin\" I read this in high schools in Ann Arbor [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q485172] which I went to read in a program called Poetry Ann Arbor, and I wanted, I read the title and then I wanted to, I read the title and then I wanted to, I found it real funny because it was called \"Heroin,\" and I wanted to disclaim that it was a pro-heroin poem. So I said, this poem is not a pro-heroin poem.Then I realized there wasn't an anti-heroin poem either.  So I ended them, it was just sort of an on-heroin poem. [Audience laughter]. All my poems are pretty much alike, and this is fairly typical of what you'll be hearing the rest of the evening. \n \nTed Berrigan\n00:03:19\nReads \"Heroin\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:04:22\nThis poem is called \"Frank O'Hara's Question\". Frank O'Hara [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q951010] is a poet from New York [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60], who's dead, he died when he was forty years old a couple of years ago in an automobile accident. The title doesn't have too much to do with the poem, except that it sort of states something that Frank O'Hara evidently had to say, and so it says something that I have to say too in my own way, not that I have to say it the same way that Frank did. \n \nTed Berrigan\n00:04:56\nReads \"Frank O\u2019Hara\u2019s Question\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:05:42\nThis is a poem I wrote in 1962. It's called \"Words for Love\". It's a bit rhetorical, but it's the best I could do in 1962, and I still like it a lot, albeit I wonder at some of it.  \"Words for Love\". It was written, actually, at a very difficult time in my life, and I guess I felt the need to make some sort of statement.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:06:09\nReads \"Words for Love\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:08:07\nReads [\"I wake up 11:30, back aching\"].\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:09:23\nReads \u201cPersonal Poem #7. \n \nTed Berrigan\n00:10:23\nReads \u201cPersonal Poem\u201d.\n \nAudience\n00:11:08\nApplause.\n\nTed Berrigan\n00:11:10\nThank you. Charlie Stanton liked that one too. [Audience laughter]. This is the last one of those kind of poems [audience laughter]. \n \nTed Berrigan\n00:11:21\nReads \u201cPersonal Poem #9\u201d.\n\nTed Berrigan\n00:12:32\nI've always liked that poem. [Laughter]. All of those are written around 1962, 61 and 62.  I want to skip up to around 1967. I wrote this poem called \"Things to do in New York City\". I was leaving New York, and this poem, like many of my poems, was written for a specific occasion. It was for someone's birthday. And the poem, it's just my poem, it's not about the other person's birthday, it's just a present for him on his birthday. \n \nTed Berrigan\n00:13:24\nReads \"Things to do in New York City\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:14:20\nThis poem is called \"Ten Things I do Every Day,\" which is...it's true, as a matter of fact, in a way. In a manner of speaking. But it's not true that it's ten things. Alas. But that was just the title, like the ten greatest movies of the year. \n \nTed Berrigan\n00:14:40\nReads \"Ten Things I do Every Day\".\n\nAudience\n00:15:16\nLaughter.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:15:21\nThat's what you do in New York. [Audience laughter]. I'll read this poem called \"Resolution\". \n \nTed Berrigan\n00:15:35\nReads \"Resolution\u201d.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:15:58\nI don't know what I'll do about it if you do, but...something. All those dramatic poems. \n \nTed Berrigan\n00:16:06\nReads \u201cSonnet XXXVII\u201d.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:17:08\nI want to move around a little and not do exactly what I said. This is a poem I wrote last summer in London [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q84], it's dedicated to the poet Tom Raworth [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7817338] and his wife. They lived in Colchester [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q184163], which is an hour or two train-ride from London, and I was supposed to go down and see them, and I didn't go. And by way of apologies, I wrote this poem to Tom and to his wife, Val.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:17:33\nReads \"Apologies to Val and Tom\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:19:05\nI'll read this one for George Bowering's old lady, [audience laughter] Mrs. Angela Bowering. It's called \"Things to do on Speed\". [Audience laughter].\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:19:19\nReads \"Things to do on Speed\" [audience laughter throughout].\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:20:58 [Laughter] I forgot about that one.  \n\nAudience \n00:21:01\nLaughter.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:21:03\nResumes reading \"Things to do on Speed\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:22:21\nI wrote that one courtesy of The New York Times [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q9684]. Okay, one more this set. This is called, \"Things to do in Providence\". [Audience laughter]. Which is, Providence [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q18383], Rhode Island [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1387], or whatever else you can make of it.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:22:50\nReads \"Things to do in Providence\".\n \nAudience\n00:26:23\nLaughter.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:26:29\nResumes reading \"Things to do in Providence\".\n \nAudience\n00:27:46\nApplause.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:27:52\n[Unintelligible].\n \nUnknown\n00:27:55\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:27:55\nHere he is again, terrible Ted Berrigan. \n \nTed Berrigan\n00:28:01\nAll the poems I'm going to read in this set are from my book, In the Early Morning Rain.  The title of this book I got from Gordon Lightfoot [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q359552], the Canadian folk singer-songwriter, and I didn't know, I made, I decided to use that title before Bobby Dylan's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q392] album Self-Portrait [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q634569] came out, so I didn't know that Bobby was going to record this song. I would have used it anyway, I'm sure. But, I mean if Dylan can steal it, I can steal it. And this book is a collection of poems of mine from over the last ten years, and I'm just going to read around in it. I wrote a lot of different kind of poems. I don't very often try for...I mean, I just take my poems where they come. This poem is called \"Hello\". \n \nTed Berrigan\n00:28:51\nReads \"Hello\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:29:06\nNow I'm going to read two or three poems that are from a section of this book called \"Life of a Man\".  \"Life of a Man\" is a book of poems in Italian by an Italian poet, a very great Italian poet who died not too long ago called Giuseppe Ungaretti [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q311802]. There's a little story behind these. A lady poet named Barbara Guest [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q807448] once asked my friend Ron Patchett and I, would we translate some of Ungaretti's poems, because Ungaretti was coming to America [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30]. And she thought it would be nice if we would translate them as a sort of homage to him. And so I told her, I said, \u201cBarbara, but we don't understand Italian,\u201d and she said, \u201cOh, I'm sure you can do it, you two are marvelous\u201d.  And she said, \u201cJust get a dictionary, and you can look up the words\u201d. So I looked at Ron and he looked at me, and we said, yeah, we can translate 'em, sure, but we don't want to get any dictionaries. So we just translated 'em without any dictionaries. [Audience laughter]. And we never showed them to Ungaretti but we showed them to Barbara Guest and she had the horrors. The first one is called \"Matinee\". \n \nTed Berrigan\n00:30:16\nReads \"Matinee\" from In the Early Morning Rain [audience laughter throughout].\n\nTed Berrigan\n00:30:26\nThe next one is called \"December\" [audience laughter].\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:30:30\nReads \"December\" from In the Early Morning Rain [audience laughter throughout].\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:30:38\nAnd this one is called \"The Reply to the Fragile.\" \n \nTed Berrigan\n00:30:42\nReads \"The Reply to the Fragile\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:30:53\nThat one's a little, that's rated X. [Audience laughter]. And this is the last one, it's called \u201cCorporal Pellegrini\u201d. If any of you know Italian, you can understand where all these words came from [audience laughter].\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:31:09\nReads \"Corporal Pellegrini\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:31:38\nI think Ungaretti would've liked them. [Audience laughter]. He probably would have retranslated them and gotten some new ones. This next work is a translation too and it's a translation I did from French, which I understand some. And so this time I only had to leave certain words. This time I translated a lot of it accurately. But it's called \"Life among the woods\". And it's a translation of a page from a grammar book, some kind of book written in the French language. After I'd gotten this much done I decided it was over. Anyway, it's called \"Life Among the Woods\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:32:20\nReads \"Life Among the Woods\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:34:30.58\nPretty interesting family. This is a poem called \"In Four Parts.\"\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:34:40.14\nReads \"In Four Parts\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:35:22\nThat was four sentences from the New York Times. They had this secret continuity. [Laughter]. This is a poem called \"March 17th, 1970\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:35:35\nReads \"March 17th, 1970\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:36:03\nAnd you'd better believe it. Only not right now, right then. I don't know if I can subject you to this poem. I guess I will anyway. This is called \"The Ten Greatest Books of the Year, 1968\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:36:28\nReads \"The Ten Greatest Books of the Year, 1968\" from In the Early Morning Rain [audience laughter throughout].\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:38:02\nYou people that are laughing are getting it.\n\nTed Berrigan\n00:38:04\nResumes reading \"The Ten Greatest Books of the Year, 1968\" from In the Early Morning Rain. \n\nAudience\n00:38:14\nLaughter.\n\nTed Berrigan\n00:38:17\nThis is a poem called \"Thirty\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:38:18\nReads \"Thirty\" from In the Early Morning Rain\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:38:24\nThat's for all of you guys that did thirty. This poem is called \"Things to do in Anne's Room\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:38:34\nReads \"Things to do in Anne's Room\" from In the Early Morning Rain\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:39:42\nThis is called \"The Great Genius\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:39:45\nReads \"The Great Genius\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:39:56\nThis is called \"Anti-War Poem\". It's another New Year's poem, actually.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:40:03\nReads \"Anti-War Poem\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:40:41\nAnd this poem is called \"Tough Brown Coat\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:40:43\nReads \"Tough Brown Coat\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:41:04\nThis poem is called \"Babe Rainbow\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:41:08\nReads \"Babe Rainbow\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:41:25\nAnd this is called \"In My Room\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:41:30\nReads \"In My Room\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:41:54\nThis is called \"Ann Arbor Elegy\". It was written for a girl who was killed in an automobile accident. September 27th, 1969. The funny thing about this poem is it was written before she was killed. And when I looked at it after she was dead, I saw that I didn't have to write an elegy for her, that somehow I'd written one already. \n \nTed Berrigan\n00:42:17\nReads \"Ann Arbor Elegy - For Franny Winston\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:43:13\nAnd this is a sort of berserk work, which I wrote called \"Wake Up,\" which is about all it says, really.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:43:23\nReads \"Wake up\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:44:18\nI have another poem which I'd like to read but I won't, but it's a series of aphorisms from the works of Francis Picabia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q157321], the French poet and painter. And this friend Jim Carroll [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q444806] and I translated these from French. I'll read you my favourite one, in any case, which Jim Carroll translated. It says, \"Spinoza [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q35802] is the one who threw a pass to move Spinoza.\" I really...in this book I put some poems by some of my friends so I wouldn't have to read all my works. Though when I read I never read theirs, I notice. This poem is called \"In Bed\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:44:56\nReads \"In Bed\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:45:12\nThat's an example of saying nothing. [Audience laughter]. This poem is called \"Easy Living\". It's dedicated to a boy named David Henderson, a poet who was a friend of mine, whom I once took a trip to Pittsburgh [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1342] with. Had a very nice time. \n \nTed Berrigan\n00:45:33\nReads \"Easy Living\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:46:25\nThis is a poem I wrote, it's called \"Like Poem\". A friend of mine wrote a love poem to this girl, and I thought I should do that too. But I only wanted to write a like poem to her, because I don't want to have any obligations. [Audience laughter]. No, that isn't the reason why, but that's what came out. This is called \"Like Poem,\" it's to Joan Fagan, who's the wife of my friend Larry Fagan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q95906997], the poet. \n \nTed Berrigan\n00:46:50\nReads \"Like Poem\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:47:06\nThis poem is called \"Ann Arbor Song\". This poem I actually tried to write a poem out of a very corny feeling that I'd had, which nevertheless is very genuine. It starts at a poetry reading in Ann Arbor, but it's really about being in Ann Arbor and realizing I was leaving soon, and thinking about all the things that wouldn't happen to me again, because this trip was going to be over.  Even though, I'm--it's not all that sentimental, I mean I knew I might go to Ann Arbor again and all that, it was just that this particular trip was going to be over. I also wrote it with the idea in mind of reading it at a poetry reading too.  \"Ann Arbor Song\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:47:45\nReads \"Ann Arbor Song\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:49:22\nI'm going to read two more. First one's called \"Peace\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:49:29 \nReads \"Peace\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n\nTed Berrigan\n00:50:37\nAlright, and this is the last poem. I hate to end heavy, but there's no place to read this poem but at the end. This poem is called \"People Who Died\". It's just a list. \"People Who Died\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:50:55\nReads \"People Who Died\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n \nAudience\n00:52:48\nApplause.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:52:53\nNot the most, uh...[laughter].\n \nEND\n00:52:59\n"

He studied briefly at Providence College until 1954 when he joined the US army, which he served three years, an eighteen months of which were spent in the Korean War. Berrigan returned to the US and completed a Bachelor\u2019s degree in English literature at the University of Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1595. It was there that he met Ron Padgett and Joe Brainard. Berrigan completed his MA in 1962, and soon after, with a number of friends from Tulsa, went north to the Lower East Side of New York City. By 1963, Berrigan had established C: A Journal of Poetry, which published not only the work of his friends, but the poetry of the older generation of New York poets and artists like Andy Warhol. In 1964, Berrigan published his most accomplished collection of poems, The Sonnets (Lorenz & Ellen Gude, 1964). Berrigan also taught at the St. Mark\u2019s Poetry Project at its conception by Paul Blackburn, helping to shape the project and its programmes in its early days. He also lectured at the State University of Michigan, University of Iowa, Yale University, the University of Michigan, and at the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado. A selection of his publications include A Lily for My Love (Self published, 1959), In the Early Morning Rain (Cape Goliard Press, 1970), Red Wagon (Yellow Press, 1976), Galileo; or Finksville a play (1964) and Bean Spasms (Kulchur Press, 1967) written with Ron Padgett. Ted Berrigan died on July 4, 1983. The most comprehensive collection of his poetry can be found in So Going Around Cities: New and Selected Poems 1958-1979 (Blue Wind Press, 1980)."

                "contents": "George Bowering\n00:00:00\nWelcome to at last the second reading in the series, for this year.  As you probably know, the series that we have, it might be loosely called a kind of an avant-garde series, and in the, this is our fifth year, and this is the first time we've ever had anybody from the New York School [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1972942]--it's not going to be the last time, we're going to have Kenneth Koch [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2708628] in the spring, and we're looking for Tom Clarke [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7815337] next fall. Berrigan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2399732] is I guess now, one of the, say the halfback, I supposed, or quarterback of the New York School. Many of you have probably seen...[laughter] yeah, linebacker! When you ask when you're a little thin... And most of you have probably seen the propaganda sheet that's been around, downstairs and so on, and so you've heard the words that some of his confreres have said about him. I'd just like to add a little bit, in addition to those earlier books such as The Sonnets, and Bean Spasms, there's a couple of new books that have just appeared, one's called In the Early Morning Rain, which will be available here because it's a Cape Goliard book, and it's distributed in Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16] by one of the big Toronto [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q172] publishers, and another one with a Kraut title that I can't read that's bilingual, half-German and half-English that I'm sure we'll hear some from....\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:01:31\nThe title's [unintelligible] Guillaume Apollinaire [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q133855] ist ...\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:01:34\nOh I see, yeah right.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:01:35\nHowever I don't have any available, only in Berlin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q64].\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:01:38\nRight, so if you happen to be in Berlin, snap up a copy of Guillaume Apollinaire ist tot und Anders. So I'd like to mention that Ted Berrigan is going to read one set, and then he wants to stop for a very short intermission, say like a five-minute intermission, and then haul you back in again and do a second set. So ladies and gentlemen, etcetera, Ted Berrigan.\n \nAudience\n00:02:05\nApplause. \n \nUnknown\n00:02:07\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed]. \n \nTed Berrigan\n00:02:08\nIn the first set I'm going to read mostly poems I've written over the last four or five years. Actually, longer than that, some going back to 1962, or '61. I don't know how long this set'll be. It'll, should be less than a half-hour. In the second set I'll read poems I've written over the last year or two. However I want to start with a poem that I wrote about two years ago. It's called \"Heroin\" I read this in high schools in Ann Arbor [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q485172] which I went to read in a program called Poetry Ann Arbor, and I wanted, I read the title and then I wanted to, I read the title and then I wanted to, I found it real funny because it was called \"Heroin,\" and I wanted to disclaim that it was a pro-heroin poem. So I said, this poem is not a pro-heroin poem.Then I realized there wasn't an anti-heroin poem either.  So I ended them, it was just sort of an on-heroin poem. [Audience laughter]. All my poems are pretty much alike, and this is fairly typical of what you'll be hearing the rest of the evening. \n \nTed Berrigan\n00:03:19\nReads \"Heroin\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:04:22\nThis poem is called \"Frank O'Hara's Question\". Frank O'Hara [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q951010] is a poet from New York [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60], who's dead, he died when he was forty years old a couple of years ago in an automobile accident. The title doesn't have too much to do with the poem, except that it sort of states something that Frank O'Hara evidently had to say, and so it says something that I have to say too in my own way, not that I have to say it the same way that Frank did. \n \nTed Berrigan\n00:04:56\nReads \"Frank O\u2019Hara\u2019s Question\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:05:42\nThis is a poem I wrote in 1962. It's called \"Words for Love\". It's a bit rhetorical, but it's the best I could do in 1962, and I still like it a lot, albeit I wonder at some of it.  \"Words for Love\". It was written, actually, at a very difficult time in my life, and I guess I felt the need to make some sort of statement.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:06:09\nReads \"Words for Love\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:08:07\nReads [\"I wake up 11:30, back aching\"].\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:09:23\nReads \u201cPersonal Poem #7. \n \nTed Berrigan\n00:10:23\nReads \u201cPersonal Poem\u201d.\n \nAudience\n00:11:08\nApplause.\n\nTed Berrigan\n00:11:10\nThank you. Charlie Stanton liked that one too. [Audience laughter]. This is the last one of those kind of poems [audience laughter]. \n \nTed Berrigan\n00:11:21\nReads \u201cPersonal Poem #9\u201d.\n\nTed Berrigan\n00:12:32\nI've always liked that poem. [Laughter]. All of those are written around 1962, 61 and 62.  I want to skip up to around 1967. I wrote this poem called \"Things to do in New York City\". I was leaving New York, and this poem, like many of my poems, was written for a specific occasion. It was for someone's birthday. And the poem, it's just my poem, it's not about the other person's birthday, it's just a present for him on his birthday. \n \nTed Berrigan\n00:13:24\nReads \"Things to do in New York City\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:14:20\nThis poem is called \"Ten Things I do Every Day,\" which is...it's true, as a matter of fact, in a way. In a manner of speaking. But it's not true that it's ten things. Alas. But that was just the title, like the ten greatest movies of the year. \n \nTed Berrigan\n00:14:40\nReads \"Ten Things I do Every Day\".\n\nAudience\n00:15:16\nLaughter.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:15:21\nThat's what you do in New York. [Audience laughter]. I'll read this poem called \"Resolution\". \n \nTed Berrigan\n00:15:35\nReads \"Resolution\u201d.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:15:58\nI don't know what I'll do about it if you do, but...something. All those dramatic poems. \n \nTed Berrigan\n00:16:06\nReads \u201cSonnet XXXVII\u201d.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:17:08\nI want to move around a little and not do exactly what I said. This is a poem I wrote last summer in London [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q84], it's dedicated to the poet Tom Raworth [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7817338] and his wife. They lived in Colchester [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q184163], which is an hour or two train-ride from London, and I was supposed to go down and see them, and I didn't go. And by way of apologies, I wrote this poem to Tom and to his wife, Val.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:17:33\nReads \"Apologies to Val and Tom\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:19:05\nI'll read this one for George Bowering's old lady, [audience laughter] Mrs. Angela Bowering. It's called \"Things to do on Speed\". [Audience laughter].\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:19:19\nReads \"Things to do on Speed\" [audience laughter throughout].\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:20:58 [Laughter] I forgot about that one.  \n\nAudience \n00:21:01\nLaughter.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:21:03\nResumes reading \"Things to do on Speed\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:22:21\nI wrote that one courtesy of The New York Times [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q9684]. Okay, one more this set. This is called, \"Things to do in Providence\". [Audience laughter]. Which is, Providence [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q18383], Rhode Island [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1387], or whatever else you can make of it.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:22:50\nReads \"Things to do in Providence\".\n \nAudience\n00:26:23\nLaughter.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:26:29\nResumes reading \"Things to do in Providence\".\n \nAudience\n00:27:46\nApplause.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:27:52\n[Unintelligible].\n \nUnknown\n00:27:55\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:27:55\nHere he is again, terrible Ted Berrigan. \n \nTed Berrigan\n00:28:01\nAll the poems I'm going to read in this set are from my book, In the Early Morning Rain.  The title of this book I got from Gordon Lightfoot [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q359552], the Canadian folk singer-songwriter, and I didn't know, I made, I decided to use that title before Bobby Dylan's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q392] album Self-Portrait [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q634569] came out, so I didn't know that Bobby was going to record this song. I would have used it anyway, I'm sure. But, I mean if Dylan can steal it, I can steal it. And this book is a collection of poems of mine from over the last ten years, and I'm just going to read around in it. I wrote a lot of different kind of poems. I don't very often try for...I mean, I just take my poems where they come. This poem is called \"Hello\". \n \nTed Berrigan\n00:28:51\nReads \"Hello\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:29:06\nNow I'm going to read two or three poems that are from a section of this book called \"Life of a Man\".  \"Life of a Man\" is a book of poems in Italian by an Italian poet, a very great Italian poet who died not too long ago called Giuseppe Ungaretti [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q311802]. There's a little story behind these. A lady poet named Barbara Guest [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q807448] once asked my friend Ron Patchett and I, would we translate some of Ungaretti's poems, because Ungaretti was coming to America [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30]. And she thought it would be nice if we would translate them as a sort of homage to him. And so I told her, I said, \u201cBarbara, but we don't understand Italian,\u201d and she said, \u201cOh, I'm sure you can do it, you two are marvelous\u201d.  And she said, \u201cJust get a dictionary, and you can look up the words\u201d. So I looked at Ron and he looked at me, and we said, yeah, we can translate 'em, sure, but we don't want to get any dictionaries. So we just translated 'em without any dictionaries. [Audience laughter]. And we never showed them to Ungaretti but we showed them to Barbara Guest and she had the horrors. The first one is called \"Matinee\". \n \nTed Berrigan\n00:30:16\nReads \"Matinee\" from In the Early Morning Rain [audience laughter throughout].\n\nTed Berrigan\n00:30:26\nThe next one is called \"December\" [audience laughter].\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:30:30\nReads \"December\" from In the Early Morning Rain [audience laughter throughout].\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:30:38\nAnd this one is called \"The Reply to the Fragile.\" \n \nTed Berrigan\n00:30:42\nReads \"The Reply to the Fragile\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:30:53\nThat one's a little, that's rated X. [Audience laughter]. And this is the last one, it's called \u201cCorporal Pellegrini\u201d. If any of you know Italian, you can understand where all these words came from [audience laughter].\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:31:09\nReads \"Corporal Pellegrini\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:31:38\nI think Ungaretti would've liked them. [Audience laughter]. He probably would have retranslated them and gotten some new ones. This next work is a translation too and it's a translation I did from French, which I understand some. And so this time I only had to leave certain words. This time I translated a lot of it accurately. But it's called \"Life among the woods\". And it's a translation of a page from a grammar book, some kind of book written in the French language. After I'd gotten this much done I decided it was over. Anyway, it's called \"Life Among the Woods\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:32:20\nReads \"Life Among the Woods\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:34:30.58\nPretty interesting family. This is a poem called \"In Four Parts.\"\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:34:40.14\nReads \"In Four Parts\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:35:22\nThat was four sentences from the New York Times. They had this secret continuity. [Laughter]. This is a poem called \"March 17th, 1970\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:35:35\nReads \"March 17th, 1970\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:36:03\nAnd you'd better believe it. Only not right now, right then. I don't know if I can subject you to this poem. I guess I will anyway. This is called \"The Ten Greatest Books of the Year, 1968\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:36:28\nReads \"The Ten Greatest Books of the Year, 1968\" from In the Early Morning Rain [audience laughter throughout].\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:38:02\nYou people that are laughing are getting it.\n\nTed Berrigan\n00:38:04\nResumes reading \"The Ten Greatest Books of the Year, 1968\" from In the Early Morning Rain. \n\nAudience\n00:38:14\nLaughter.\n\nTed Berrigan\n00:38:17\nThis is a poem called \"Thirty\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:38:18\nReads \"Thirty\" from In the Early Morning Rain\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:38:24\nThat's for all of you guys that did thirty. This poem is called \"Things to do in Anne's Room\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:38:34\nReads \"Things to do in Anne's Room\" from In the Early Morning Rain\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:39:42\nThis is called \"The Great Genius\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:39:45\nReads \"The Great Genius\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:39:56\nThis is called \"Anti-War Poem\".

It was written for a girl who was killed in an automobile accident. September 27th, 1969. The funny thing about this poem is it was written before she was killed. And when I looked at it after she was dead, I saw that I didn't have to write an elegy for her, that somehow I'd written one already. \n \nTed Berrigan\n00:42:17\nReads \"Ann Arbor Elegy - For Franny Winston\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:43:13\nAnd this is a sort of berserk work, which I wrote called \"Wake Up,\" which is about all it says, really.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:43:23\nReads \"Wake up\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:44:18\nI have another poem which I'd like to read but I won't, but it's a series of aphorisms from the works of Francis Picabia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q157321], the French poet and painter. And this friend Jim Carroll [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q444806] and I translated these from French. I'll read you my favourite one, in any case, which Jim Carroll translated. It says, \"Spinoza [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q35802] is the one who threw a pass to move Spinoza.\" I really...in this book I put some poems by some of my friends so I wouldn't have to read all my works. Though when I read I never read theirs, I notice. This poem is called \"In Bed\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:44:56\nReads \"In Bed\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:45:12\nThat's an example of saying nothing. [Audience laughter]. This poem is called \"Easy Living\". It's dedicated to a boy named David Henderson, a poet who was a friend of mine, whom I once took a trip to Pittsburgh [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1342] with. Had a very nice time. \n \nTed Berrigan\n00:45:33\nReads \"Easy Living\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:46:25\nThis is a poem I wrote, it's called \"Like Poem\". A friend of mine wrote a love poem to this girl, and I thought I should do that too. But I only wanted to write a like poem to her, because I don't want to have any obligations. [Audience laughter]. No, that isn't the reason why, but that's what came out. This is called \"Like Poem,\" it's to Joan Fagan, who's the wife of my friend Larry Fagan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q95906997], the poet. \n \nTed Berrigan\n00:46:50\nReads \"Like Poem\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:47:06\nThis poem is called \"Ann Arbor Song\". This poem I actually tried to write a poem out of a very corny feeling that I'd had, which nevertheless is very genuine. It starts at a poetry reading in Ann Arbor, but it's really about being in Ann Arbor and realizing I was leaving soon, and thinking about all the things that wouldn't happen to me again, because this trip was going to be over.  Even though, I'm--it's not all that sentimental, I mean I knew I might go to Ann Arbor again and all that, it was just that this particular trip was going to be over. I also wrote it with the idea in mind of reading it at a poetry reading too.  \"Ann Arbor Song\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:47:45\nReads \"Ann Arbor Song\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:49:22\nI'm going to read two more. First one's called \"Peace\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:49:29 \nReads \"Peace\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n\nTed Berrigan\n00:50:37\nAlright, and this is the last poem. I hate to end heavy, but there's no place to read this poem but at the end. This poem is called \"People Who Died\". It's just a list. \"People Who Died\".\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:50:55\nReads \"People Who Died\" from In the Early Morning Rain.\n \nAudience\n00:52:48\nApplause.\n \nTed Berrigan\n00:52:53\nNot the most, uh...[laughter].\n \nEND\n00:52:59\n",

            "contents": "dorothy_livesay_i086-11-032-1.mp3 [File 1 of 2]\n \nIntroducer\n00:00:02\nI was going to talk on about Dorothy Livesay's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1250325] distinguished career, as a poet, and a critic and a teacher, but after what she told me tonight, I'm not sure if distinguished is exactly the right word, she says that at the age of nineteen, she snubbed the Prince of Wales [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q590227]. Nevertheless, two books should be mentioned, her selected and uncollected poems to appear this September and a book which was called 39 Women Poets which has gained another poet and another title at the last moment and as 40 Women Poets of Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16] is now on sale outside, as you may have seen as you came in. Back in 1965, I guess it was, Wynne Francis managed to catch Dorothy Livesay as she was passing through Montreal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q340], and Dorothy gave a really private reading in Wynne's office. Ever since then, we have been trying to convince her to come back and read to us all in the series. I'm extremely happy this year that we have been successful and that I can present to you Dorothy Livesay.\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:01:58\nI think I might get hung up on this, I had quite a disastrous time getting here. I arrived with a new poem of seven, whose title is \"Disasters of the Sun\", and my first disaster was on the train, sitting on top of my glasses, which are now somewhat myopic, and second disaster going to Sherbrooke [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q139473], the bus rolled right into an oil tanker, which somehow or other didn't blow up, but gashed my thumb, and at Bishop's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3551383] I had only begun to read when a fire alarm started [laughter], and rang for ten minutes before they silenced it. So I have a feeling that somehow or other, there are more disasters ahead tonight. However, I'm supposed to read a while and then call an intermission I think. Mostly I like to sort of go back over the years and trace the different things, especially love poems from early times on, but I'm going to skip about a bit. Recently in Edmonton [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2096] I edited the fourth issue of a quarterly magazine, White Pelican. Which Sheila Watson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7493167] edits but she gave this particular issue to me, and I chose the theme of North. Feeling perhaps that we are still trying to find our identity, whether we're English Canadians or French Canadians, and that perhaps the north has some element of it in it which helps us to find that. I discovered though, in collecting material, stories, poems, plays about the north, that it was the Native Indian people who have a different view altogether of the north than we do. At the same time, you find many young Canadian poets identifying with Native culture, and almost feeling that they must become Native, and become Indian to be real, to know who they are. I wrote at the beginning of this issue this little note I'll just read. \u201cNorth is from wherever you are looking.\u201d It's starting...[laughter]. \u201cFor those living below the 49th parallel, Canada itself is North. In a sense, we're all here as explorers without a home. Our great guilt at having ousted the Native peoples from their land is now seeking expression in an attempt to re-create the Indian and Eskimo past, and every month brings forth books of poetry, fiction and history which seek to come to terms with pre-history, with myth, or with the way the Inuit live in harmony with nature. In ironic contrast, the Native artists and writers are expressing their concern, not with their past, but with possible ways of accommodation to the present, the white man's world. Thus, the three British Columbia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1974] Indian poets here represented, Skyros Bruce, Gordy Williams and Eleanor Crow are bitter, ironic and contemporary. Not for them the nostalgic recreation of the Indian myth, or even  not for them the vigorous folk humor of life in the north which you find in [unintelligible] and in later writers.\u201d While I think it's worthwhile thinking about that because you do have a lot of young poets now seeping themselves in Indian or Eskimo culture, and feeling as if they must become that in order to be themselves. None of us can quite escape from this, and I have a poem or two that I'll begin with, which I suppose are my expression of coming to terms with the North, or the somewhat southernly north, Edmonton. I'll begin with a kind of collage poem where I put bits of history, bits of visual imagery and bits of surrealism together, called \"Edmonton Sweet\".\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:06:56\nReads \"Edmonton Sweet\" [from Plainsongs].\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:10:19\nQuite a different poem about going North is called \"The Operation\", and that is the poem which is in this anthology, just out today, 40 Women Poets. I didn't intend to put myself in, but the other editors suggested it was the only 'done' thing to put one or two poems of my own in it. So here's the one called \"The Operation\". It's a kind of three-way poem where the woman is addressing the doctor and her lover, alternately, and then perhaps herself.\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:11:10\nReads \"The Operation\" [from Plainsongs and collected in 40 Women Poets] .\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:15:36\nSince this anthology will probably be called a women's lib., even though it isn't, because none of the poets in it are consciously trying to be anything but their individual selves, nonetheless, I think there are poems by every woman which do express that individual point of view, that differentness, I have never been able, though perhaps I was a women's lib. creature in the thirties, I have never been able to feel that men and women are the same, and so I have poems, right through the years which illustrate that point of view. Here's a very recent one called \"The Woman Syndrome\".\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:16:26\nReads \"The Woman Syndrome\" [published later in Archive For Our Times].\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:17:05\nAnd a much earlier poem, written when I had a family and young children and I suppose frustrated and not getting out into the world. It's called \"Other\", it's in The Selected Poems of 1957.\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:17:34\nReads \"Other\" from Selected Poems, 1926-1956.\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:19:11\nAnd in a different vein altogether, the poem I suppose that's been the most anthologized of any of mine, which to me is a rather traditional way I suppose of seeing the male and female element. It's called \"Bartok and the Geranium\". The poem simply began because I was teaching an evening class of housewives the art of creative writing, and I gave them an assignment to write an imagistic or perhaps haiku-type poem, when they got home, to look at two objects, utterly different and disparate, and just see they could link these objects in a tension which would create a poem. Well the next day, I had sent the children to school after lunch and was sitting in the dining room listening to a CBC [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q461761] concert, and heard music that I hadn't heard before at all, a violin concerto it seemed to be, and in the window as I was listening was this red geranium. So I thought to myself, well I've given my class an assignment, I wonder if I could do the same thing. And at the end of the concert they announced that it was Bela Bartok [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q83326], violin concerto. So suddenly, the two elements, the music and the geranium, did seem to link in my mind and immediately I wrote the poem which I think I've never revised. I'll tell you afterwards about what some of the professors have said about the meaning of the poem.\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:21:00\nReads \"Bartok and Geranium\" [from New Poems].\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:22:10\nWell, a few years later, Dr. Roy Daniels was giving a course in Canadian Literature, which I was a member, and one day he asked me if I would not come to class, so I divined he was going to deal with my poems, and I asked a fellow student to please take notes. So this was one of the poems he dealt with, and he informed the class that this poem represented the conflict between nature and art. While at first I was a bit dumbfounded, you know now about how the whole thing began and then what I felt about the he and she of it. But perhaps upon meditation, that this could be another meaning in the poem which I as poet, wasn't aware of but which was still perhaps there. But still another example of the different interpretations which people take to themselves and perhaps get great pleasure from, was, happened in U.N.B. [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1112515] when Fred Cogswell [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5494855] put this poem on a sight examination for a first year Canadian lit. class, and one of the students who I'm afraid failed his year, wrote on the paper, and on seeing this poem decided that it was written by a man, and he said it was about this guy Bartok who walked along the street and saw a whore leaning out of the window. Well on the same, and finally, this last one on the same kind of he and she of it, a poem written about a year ago, right out of a dream, I mean I dreamed this poem. It's called \"Latter Day Eve\".\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:24:18\nReads \"Latter Day Eve\" [from Plainsongs].\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:25:34\nWell I'd like to jump back a bit, quite a long way back now, not to lyrical poems, which were the ones I really started out doing, but two poems from the thirties...\n\nEND\n00:25:51\n[Unknown amount of time elapsed between tapes].\n\ndorothy_livesay_i086-11-032-2.mp3 [File 2 of 2]\n\nDorothy Livesay\n00:00:00\n...Polish immigrant who came back to the same house to pick up his belongings, and not knowing what was happening, entered the house, and police shot him in the back and killed him. This happened in Montreal in 1934 or 5. So out of all those experiences, through the thirties, and out of another year I had in New Jersey [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1408], living amongst the Negro, very, very discriminated against people in Englewood [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q986210], New Jersey. I, my whole poetry changed from being lyrical and personal to being social and yet I always, never felt it was something outside myself because I felt very powerfully the identification to what was happening to people. I returned from New Jersey about '36 and I wrote this poem which E.J. Pratt [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3045744] published in the first issue of the Canadian Poetry Magazine in \u201836. I guess I wrote it in about 1935. In it, there are various themes, the whole poem seemed to start from Cole Porter's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q215120] lines, the song we were all singing then, \"Night and Day\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1477068]. \u201cNight and day, you are the one\u2026\u201d And then also there's a theme from Lennon [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1203], who said \"In order to make two steps forward you may have to go one step back\". And this poem reverses that idea, in looking at industrial capitalist society. The other theme is that of the Negro and that of his exploitation and also of his release in song, and in Negro spiritual, because I did know them very well that year.\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:02:16\nReads \"Day and Night\" from Day and Night.\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:07:57\nI might read one more poem from that period, \"Lorca\", and then perhaps you'd like a break. This is a little later, of course, this is about 1937-8, when the Spanish Civil War [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q10859] was raging and haunted us very much in this country, many friends we knew joined the MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1668887], and went to fight for Spain [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q29]. At that time, we believed that the Spanish Court, Garcia Lorca [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q41408], had been killed by Franco's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q29179] men. I believe that, well in fact, Jack Spicer [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3805658] taught me that there's another version of his killing, that of a love triangle, but it didn't matter, the point was that many poets were fighting for Spain, and many were killed. So I'll just read \"Lorca\" if I can find it. Yes.\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:09:15\nReads \"Lorca\" [from Day and Night].\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:11:29\nI'll pause now for a break. \n\nUnknown\n00:11:32\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n\nDorothy Livesay\n00:11:33\nAnd though I don't want to appear to suit every taste, quite a lot of my poetry has been personal love poetry, beginning with the earliest days, my teenage, and I thought I would read a few very early love poems and then you could, you might be interested to compare them with those written within the last five or six years. These were from a book published in 1932, Signpost. And you'll notice that they're pretty well structured, and in a sense quite conventional, but perhaps they have a kind of feeling in them. \"Weapons\".\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:12:25\nReads \"Weapons\" from Signpost.\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:12:54\nReads \"Alienation\" [from Signpost].\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:13:26\nReads \"Climax\" [from Signpost].\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:13:47\nReads \"Blindness\" [from Signpost].\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:14:11\nAnd a very short lyric, \"Song for Solomon\".\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:14:17\nReads \"Song for Solomon\" [from Signpost].\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:14:36\nAnd now, recent poems from the 1967 book, The Unquiet Bed. I'll read a little ballad that is the title poem, which one of my students set to music at one point. \"The Unquiet Bed\".\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:14:56\nReads \"The Unquiet Bed\" from The Unquiet Bed.\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:15:25\nAnd \"Four Songs\".\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:15:32\nReads \"Four Songs\" [from The Unquiet Bed].\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:16:41\nAnd a poem which certainly wouldn't be acceptable to women's lib., yet it's an experience probably all women have had. It's called \"The Taming\".\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:16:52\nReads \"The Taming\" [from The Unquiet Bed].\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:17:34\nAnd \"The Touching\".\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:17:39\nReads \"The Touching\" [from The Unquiet Bed].\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:18:49\nAnd a little poem called \"Give Us Our Trespasses\", which was an attempt to do what Jack Spicer had advised us at some of his sessions, to completely wipe out all sensation, all the senses and see what happened when the words came out of this void, out of this [unintelligible] and I did one poem about dreams dedicated to him, and then a little later, this other one came. One would listen in the dark for the words, but not expecting or unexpecting, you understand, but they would certainly arrive and I would turn on the light and write them down. And then turn off the light, turn to sleep again, but again, more words came, and so this series has about seven of these little interludes in it.\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:19:52\nReads \"And Give Us Our Trespasses\" [from The Unquiet Bed].\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:21:08\nAnd two more from that book, one has five sections--six sections in it, it's called \"The Notations of Love\".\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:21:22\nReads \"The Notations of Love\" [from The Unquiet Bed].\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:23:27\nAnd a last one from there, \"Moving Out\".\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:23:33\nReads \"Moving Out\" [from The Unquiet Bed].\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:24:07\nWell, I have a few more recent poems, dealing a little differently perhaps with love. This is in the little book Plainsongs, which is still in print. \"At Dawn\".\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:24:30\nReads \"At Dawn\" from Plainsongs.\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:24:58\nAnd \"Dream\".\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:25:03\nReads \"Dream\" [from Plainsongs].\n  \nDorothy Livesay\n00:25:30\nAnd this one \"The Uninvited\", the river in this is the St. John [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q607546] in New Brunswick [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1965] and it's a theme that reoccurs a lot, whether one is a man or a woman, the feeling that even though one is walking with one's loved one, there is another lover who one also remembers, or who perhaps is coming, one fears.\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:26:09\nReads \"The Uninvited\" [from Plainsongs].\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:27:08\nAnd perhaps just this last one, \"Another Journey\".\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:27:17\nReads \"Another Journey\" [from Plainsongs].\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:28:08\nI'd like to read a poem about the West Coast. It was written summer before last, in Victoria [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2132], where one was, I suppose, feeling one's age, and yet observing the eternal pattern of the young. And perhaps relating it to our own history in this country. It's a more, I suppose, didactic poem. \"The Artefacts, West Coast\".\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:28:51\nReads \"The Artefacts, West Coast\" [from Plainsongs; cut off].\n \nEND\n00:32:14\n"

                "notes": "Poet Dorothy Livesay was born in Winnipeg in 1909, and moved to Toronto in 1920, when her father managed the Canadian Press. In the fall of 1926 she started studying at Trinity College, University of Toronto, where she was influenced by ideas of socialism and women\u2019s rights. She published her first collection of poetry, Green pitcher (Macmillan, 1928) when she was only eighteen. Livesay then went to the south of France to study for one year, and after her graduation in 1931 (B.A.) she studied at the Sorbonne in Paris where she received a Dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures, in 1932. Influenced and affected by the Depression, she began studies at University of Toronto\u2019s School of Social Work, joining the Communist Party. The same year, 1932, she published her second book, Signpost (Macmillan). She then moved to Montreal from 1933-1934, and to Englewood, New Jersey from 1934-1935, working with the unemployed as a social worker. During this time she also wrote for the Marxist news magazine New Frontier, Canadian Poetry Magazine and The Canadian Forum. Dorothy Livesay\u2019s political poetry includes Day and Night (Ryerson Press, 1944) and Poems for the People (Ryerson Press, 1947), both of which won the Governor General\u2019s Award. Married in 1937 to Duncan Macnair, Livesay raised two children in Vancouver. In 1960, when her husband had died and her children began their own lives, Dorothy Livesay moved to Zambia, where she taught English for UNESCO for three years. Returning to Vancouver, she earned a M.E.D. (1966) from University of British Columbia. She became involved in the Vancouver poetry scene and she experienced a change of style and content in her writing. She published The Unquiet Bed, illustrated by Roy Kiyooka (Ryerson Press, 1967), and Plainsongs (Fiddlehead Poetry Books, 1971), which both focused on aspects of femaleness. Livesay founded an important poetry magazine CV\/II in 1975 and edited the anthology, Forty Women Poets of Canada in 1971 (Ingluvin Press). Dorothy Livesay also published several long poems, The Documentaries (Ryerson Press, 1968), Nine Poems of Farewell (Black Moss Press, 1973), The Raw Edges: Voices From Our Time (Turnstone Press, 1981), Phases of Love (Coach House Press, 1983), Feeling Worlds (Goose Lane\/Fiddlehead,1984) and The Self-completing Tree (Porcepic Press, 1986). She also wrote several works of prose, including A Winnipeg Childhood (Peguis, 1973) and Beginnings (Newpress, 1988). She was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1987 and was the writer-in-residence and professor of English at many Canadian Universities. Livesay died in 1996."

                "contents": "dorothy_livesay_i086-11-032-1.mp3 [File 1 of 2]\n \nIntroducer\n00:00:02\nI was going to talk on about Dorothy Livesay's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1250325] distinguished career, as a poet, and a critic and a teacher, but after what she told me tonight, I'm not sure if distinguished is exactly the right word, she says that at the age of nineteen, she snubbed the Prince of Wales [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q590227]. Nevertheless, two books should be mentioned, her selected and uncollected poems to appear this September and a book which was called 39 Women Poets which has gained another poet and another title at the last moment and as 40 Women Poets of Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16] is now on sale outside, as you may have seen as you came in. Back in 1965, I guess it was, Wynne Francis managed to catch Dorothy Livesay as she was passing through Montreal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q340], and Dorothy gave a really private reading in Wynne's office. Ever since then, we have been trying to convince her to come back and read to us all in the series. I'm extremely happy this year that we have been successful and that I can present to you Dorothy Livesay.\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:01:58\nI think I might get hung up on this, I had quite a disastrous time getting here. I arrived with a new poem of seven, whose title is \"Disasters of the Sun\", and my first disaster was on the train, sitting on top of my glasses, which are now somewhat myopic, and second disaster going to Sherbrooke [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q139473], the bus rolled right into an oil tanker, which somehow or other didn't blow up, but gashed my thumb, and at Bishop's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3551383] I had only begun to read when a fire alarm started [laughter], and rang for ten minutes before they silenced it. So I have a feeling that somehow or other, there are more disasters ahead tonight. However, I'm supposed to read a while and then call an intermission I think. Mostly I like to sort of go back over the years and trace the different things, especially love poems from early times on, but I'm going to skip about a bit. Recently in Edmonton [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2096] I edited the fourth issue of a quarterly magazine, White Pelican. Which Sheila Watson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7493167] edits but she gave this particular issue to me, and I chose the theme of North. Feeling perhaps that we are still trying to find our identity, whether we're English Canadians or French Canadians, and that perhaps the north has some element of it in it which helps us to find that. I discovered though, in collecting material, stories, poems, plays about the north, that it was the Native Indian people who have a different view altogether of the north than we do. At the same time, you find many young Canadian poets identifying with Native culture, and almost feeling that they must become Native, and become Indian to be real, to know who they are. I wrote at the beginning of this issue this little note I'll just read. \u201cNorth is from wherever you are looking.\u201d It's starting...[laughter]. \u201cFor those living below the 49th parallel, Canada itself is North. In a sense, we're all here as explorers without a home. Our great guilt at having ousted the Native peoples from their land is now seeking expression in an attempt to re-create the Indian and Eskimo past, and every month brings forth books of poetry, fiction and history which seek to come to terms with pre-history, with myth, or with the way the Inuit live in harmony with nature. In ironic contrast, the Native artists and writers are expressing their concern, not with their past, but with possible ways of accommodation to the present, the white man's world. Thus, the three British Columbia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1974] Indian poets here represented, Skyros Bruce, Gordy Williams and Eleanor Crow are bitter, ironic and contemporary. Not for them the nostalgic recreation of the Indian myth, or even  not for them the vigorous folk humor of life in the north which you find in [unintelligible] and in later writers.\u201d While I think it's worthwhile thinking about that because you do have a lot of young poets now seeping themselves in Indian or Eskimo culture, and feeling as if they must become that in order to be themselves. None of us can quite escape from this, and I have a poem or two that I'll begin with, which I suppose are my expression of coming to terms with the North, or the somewhat southernly north, Edmonton. I'll begin with a kind of collage poem where I put bits of history, bits of visual imagery and bits of surrealism together, called \"Edmonton Sweet\".\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:06:56\nReads \"Edmonton Sweet\" [from Plainsongs].\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:10:19\nQuite a different poem about going North is called \"The Operation\", and that is the poem which is in this anthology, just out today, 40 Women Poets. I didn't intend to put myself in, but the other editors suggested it was the only 'done' thing to put one or two poems of my own in it. So here's the one called \"The Operation\". It's a kind of three-way poem where the woman is addressing the doctor and her lover, alternately, and then perhaps herself.\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:11:10\nReads \"The Operation\" [from Plainsongs and collected in 40 Women Poets] .\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:15:36\nSince this anthology will probably be called a women's lib., even though it isn't, because none of the poets in it are consciously trying to be anything but their individual selves, nonetheless, I think there are poems by every woman which do express that individual point of view, that differentness, I have never been able, though perhaps I was a women's lib. creature in the thirties, I have never been able to feel that men and women are the same, and so I have poems, right through the years which illustrate that point of view. Here's a very recent one called \"The Woman Syndrome\".\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:16:26\nReads \"The Woman Syndrome\" [published later in Archive For Our Times].\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:17:05\nAnd a much earlier poem, written when I had a family and young children and I suppose frustrated and not getting out into the world. It's called \"Other\", it's in The Selected Poems of 1957.\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:17:34\nReads \"Other\" from Selected Poems, 1926-1956.\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:19:11\nAnd in a different vein altogether, the poem I suppose that's been the most anthologized of any of mine, which to me is a rather traditional way I suppose of seeing the male and female element. It's called \"Bartok and the Geranium\". The poem simply began because I was teaching an evening class of housewives the art of creative writing, and I gave them an assignment to write an imagistic or perhaps haiku-type poem, when they got home, to look at two objects, utterly different and disparate, and just see they could link these objects in a tension which would create a poem. Well the next day, I had sent the children to school after lunch and was sitting in the dining room listening to a CBC [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q461761] concert, and heard music that I hadn't heard before at all, a violin concerto it seemed to be, and in the window as I was listening was this red geranium. So I thought to myself, well I've given my class an assignment, I wonder if I could do the same thing. And at the end of the concert they announced that it was Bela Bartok [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q83326], violin concerto. So suddenly, the two elements, the music and the geranium, did seem to link in my mind and immediately I wrote the poem which I think I've never revised. I'll tell you afterwards about what some of the professors have said about the meaning of the poem.\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:21:00\nReads \"Bartok and Geranium\" [from New Poems].\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:22:10\nWell, a few years later, Dr. Roy Daniels was giving a course in Canadian Literature, which I was a member, and one day he asked me if I would not come to class, so I divined he was going to deal with my poems, and I asked a fellow student to please take notes. So this was one of the poems he dealt with, and he informed the class that this poem represented the conflict between nature and art. While at first I was a bit dumbfounded, you know now about how the whole thing began and then what I felt about the he and she of it. But perhaps upon meditation, that this could be another meaning in the poem which I as poet, wasn't aware of but which was still perhaps there. But still another example of the different interpretations which people take to themselves and perhaps get great pleasure from, was, happened in U.N.B. [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1112515] when Fred Cogswell [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5494855] put this poem on a sight examination for a first year Canadian lit. class, and one of the students who I'm afraid failed his year, wrote on the paper, and on seeing this poem decided that it was written by a man, and he said it was about this guy Bartok who walked along the street and saw a whore leaning out of the window. Well on the same, and finally, this last one on the same kind of he and she of it, a poem written about a year ago, right out of a dream, I mean I dreamed this poem. It's called \"Latter Day Eve\".\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:24:18\nReads \"Latter Day Eve\" [from Plainsongs].\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:25:34\nWell I'd like to jump back a bit, quite a long way back now, not to lyrical poems, which were the ones I really started out doing, but two poems from the thirties...\n\nEND\n00:25:51\n[Unknown amount of time elapsed between tapes].",

This happened in Montreal in 1934 or 5. So out of all those experiences, through the thirties, and out of another year I had in New Jersey [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1408], living amongst the Negro, very, very discriminated against people in Englewood [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q986210], New Jersey. I, my whole poetry changed from being lyrical and personal to being social and yet I always, never felt it was something outside myself because I felt very powerfully the identification to what was happening to people. I returned from New Jersey about '36 and I wrote this poem which E.J. Pratt [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3045744] published in the first issue of the Canadian Poetry Magazine in \u201836. I guess I wrote it in about 1935. In it, there are various themes, the whole poem seemed to start from Cole Porter's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q215120] lines, the song we were all singing then, \"Night and Day\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1477068]. \u201cNight and day, you are the one\u2026\u201d And then also there's a theme from Lennon [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1203], who said \"In order to make two steps forward you may have to go one step back\". And this poem reverses that idea, in looking at industrial capitalist society. The other theme is that of the Negro and that of his exploitation and also of his release in song, and in Negro spiritual, because I did know them very well that year.\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:02:16\nReads \"Day and Night\" from Day and Night.\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:07:57\nI might read one more poem from that period, \"Lorca\", and then perhaps you'd like a break. This is a little later, of course, this is about 1937-8, when the Spanish Civil War [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q10859] was raging and haunted us very much in this country, many friends we knew joined the MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1668887], and went to fight for Spain [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q29]. At that time, we believed that the Spanish Court, Garcia Lorca [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q41408], had been killed by Franco's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q29179] men. I believe that, well in fact, Jack Spicer [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3805658] taught me that there's another version of his killing, that of a love triangle, but it didn't matter, the point was that many poets were fighting for Spain, and many were killed. So I'll just read \"Lorca\" if I can find it. Yes.\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:09:15\nReads \"Lorca\" [from Day and Night].\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:11:29\nI'll pause now for a break. \n\nUnknown\n00:11:32\n[Cut or edit made in tape.

These were from a book published in 1932, Signpost. And you'll notice that they're pretty well structured, and in a sense quite conventional, but perhaps they have a kind of feeling in them. \"Weapons\".\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:12:25\nReads \"Weapons\" from Signpost.\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:12:54\nReads \"Alienation\" [from Signpost].\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:13:26\nReads \"Climax\" [from Signpost].\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:13:47\nReads \"Blindness\" [from Signpost].\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:14:11\nAnd a very short lyric, \"Song for Solomon\".\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:14:17\nReads \"Song for Solomon\" [from Signpost].\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:14:36\nAnd now, recent poems from the 1967 book, The Unquiet Bed.

One would listen in the dark for the words, but not expecting or unexpecting, you understand, but they would certainly arrive and I would turn on the light and write them down. And then turn off the light, turn to sleep again, but again, more words came, and so this series has about seven of these little interludes in it.\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:19:52\nReads \"And Give Us Our Trespasses\" [from The Unquiet Bed].\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:21:08\nAnd two more from that book, one has five sections--six sections in it, it's called \"The Notations of Love\".\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:21:22\nReads \"The Notations of Love\" [from The Unquiet Bed].\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:23:27\nAnd a last one from there, \"Moving Out\".\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:23:33\nReads \"Moving Out\" [from The Unquiet Bed].\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:24:07\nWell, I have a few more recent poems, dealing a little differently perhaps with love. This is in the little book Plainsongs, which is still in print. \"At Dawn\".\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:24:30\nReads \"At Dawn\" from Plainsongs.\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:24:58\nAnd \"Dream\".\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:25:03\nReads \"Dream\" [from Plainsongs].\n  \nDorothy Livesay\n00:25:30\nAnd this one \"The Uninvited\", the river in this is the St. John [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q607546] in New Brunswick [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1965] and it's a theme that reoccurs a lot, whether one is a man or a woman, the feeling that even though one is walking with one's loved one, there is another lover who one also remembers, or who perhaps is coming, one fears.\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:26:09\nReads \"The Uninvited\" [from Plainsongs].\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:27:08\nAnd perhaps just this last one, \"Another Journey\".\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:27:17\nReads \"Another Journey\" [from Plainsongs].\n \nDorothy Livesay\n00:28:08\nI'd like to read a poem about the West Coast. It was written summer before last, in Victoria [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2132], where one was, I suppose, feeling one's age, and yet observing the eternal pattern of the young. And perhaps relating it to our own history in this country.

We're just going to throw the thing open to both David McFadden [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5237344] and Gerry Gilbert [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5552756] and they will work it out as it seems to work out for them. This makes a lot of sense, although they've never read together before, they're both published by the same publishing house, and published in the same magazines and know each other as they used to say in the old days in the ivy league by reputation. Gerry Gilbert is, as a lot of people we've had this year, is from the West Coast and has been involved for quite a while with an outfit in the coast that gobbles up your tax money called Intermedia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q39079179], that's why the screen is there, something might happen there occasionally. Gerry was at one time the editor of a seminal West Coast publishing venture called Radio Free Rain Forest, and is the author of a series of books and things that are like books, as for instance, White Lunch which came out several years ago in Vancouver [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q24639] and Telephone Book which is published by Coach House Press, I think, no, Weed\/Flower, sorry. David's also been published by Weed\/Flower and the Coach House Press, and his forthcoming book is the second volume of the Big\/Little Book novel, called The Great Canadian Sonnet with illustrations by a little-known London [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q92561] artist named Greg Curnoe [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5605459]. His next book is going to be called Poems Worth Knowing, a title that anyone from Ontario [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1904] or British Columbia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1974] will know. What we're going to do is they're going to operate for a little while, and then when they feel the need for a break there will be a short intermission, like about ten minutes, then we'll proceed again with what, as they say, the second set.

                "contents": "George Bowering\n00:00:08\nWe have two readers tonight, both Canadian poets, as you know, and, but in most cases when we have two poets as we did last time, we generally have one poet read for a while, then have a break, and then have the other poet read for a while, but we're not going to do it that way tonight. We're just going to throw the thing open to both David McFadden [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5237344] and Gerry Gilbert [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5552756] and they will work it out as it seems to work out for them. This makes a lot of sense, although they've never read together before, they're both published by the same publishing house, and published in the same magazines and know each other as they used to say in the old days in the ivy league by reputation. Gerry Gilbert is, as a lot of people we've had this year, is from the West Coast and has been involved for quite a while with an outfit in the coast that gobbles up your tax money called Intermedia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q39079179], that's why the screen is there, something might happen there occasionally. Gerry was at one time the editor of a seminal West Coast publishing venture called Radio Free Rain Forest, and is the author of a series of books and things that are like books, as for instance, White Lunch which came out several years ago in Vancouver [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q24639] and Telephone Book which is published by Coach House Press, I think, no, Weed\/Flower, sorry. David's also been published by Weed\/Flower and the Coach House Press, and his forthcoming book is the second volume of the Big\/Little Book novel, called The Great Canadian Sonnet with illustrations by a little-known London [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q92561] artist named Greg Curnoe [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5605459]. His next book is going to be called Poems Worth Knowing, a title that anyone from Ontario [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1904] or British Columbia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1974] will know. What we're going to do is they're going to operate for a little while, and then when they feel the need for a break there will be a short intermission, like about ten minutes, then we'll proceed again with what, as they say, the second set. So I'm not going to be able to say that somebody's reading first and somebody's reading second but what I will be able to say is that the readers will be David McFadden and Gerry Gilbert.\n \nUnknown\n00:02:39\n[Cut or edit made in tape.

Those that have been involved in reading American poetry over the past few years will naturally know who Kenneth Koch is, that he along with Frank O'Hara [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q951010] probably invented modern American poetry in New York City [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60], and it's, and he's also been in the news lately in the various, Slick magazine in the United States [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30] as a teacher of poetry, a very important teacher of poetry to kids in schools. And he's the only man I know who's been able to write what I think is probably an epic in the American language. So I'd like to make this as fast as I can and introduce Mr. Kenneth Koch.\n \nAudience\n00:00:58\nApplause.\n \nUnknown\n00:01:03\n[Cut or edit in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:01:04\nThe first poem I'll read is called \"Spring\". \n \nKenneth Koch\n00:01:08\nReads \"Spring\" [from Thank You and Other Poems].\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:02:36\nThe next poem I want to read is called \"Variations on a Theme by William Carlos Williams\". I love Williams' [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q178106] work, and I usually only write parodies of people whose work I like a lot. This parody is based on a poem of Williams, well, actually, on a certain characteristic I saw in Williams' work for a long time which I like, which is sort of, the idea that if you really like something enough and if you want to do it enough, it's okay to do it. And I saw certain insane possibilities of this viewpoint. This is specifically a parody of a poem which goes, \"This is just to say I've eaten the plums in the icebox and which you were probably saving for breakfast. Forgive me, they were so cold and so delicious\". It's really a nice poem, but it seemed to me there was a little streak of insanity running through it. It's called, \"Variations on a Theme by William Carlos Williams\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:03:28\nReads \"Variations on a Theme by William Carlos Williams\" [from Thank You and Other Poems].\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:04:33\nI'd like to read another short poem, this is called \"You Were Wearing\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:04:38\nReads \"You Were Wearing\" [from Thank You and Other Poems].\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:06:37\nI'm trying to find the ideal lights still, it\u2019s--okay, I think that's probably a bit better. The next thing that I want to read is a play called \"E.KOLOGY\". It's...E.KOLOGY is the name of the hero, it's like capital \"E,\" period, capital \"KOLOGY.\" I'd like to say something about this play. I read it at the University of Chicago [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q131252] last year, and some students thought that I was making fun of the ecology movement. I'm not, and I would see to it that if it were produced that that was not the case. It just seemed to me that the ecology movement was such a, like a natural cause for pleasure that it wouldn't really do to be totally solemn about it. The, I wrote this to be performed on Earth Day [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q124473], in New York last year in April, but they were supposed to have all these things in Union Square [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q110007] and it just ended up being a lot of light shows and speeches, I think, because they couldn't get the actors together and the lights and the stage and everything. It was done in Philadelphia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1345], did anyone see it, by any chance? Probably not. I didn't see it. I didn't even know it was done. In any case.

No one's ever done it. Apparently it would cost a great deal to do this, although it's very simple.

This is a very short poem called, \"Poem\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:21:53\nReads \"Poem\" [from The Pleasures of Peace and Other Poems].\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:22:11\nThis, this poem is called \"Ma Provence\", and my interest in writing it was the different way that French and English sound to me. \"Ma Provence\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:22:23\nReads \"Ma Provence\" [from The Pleasures of Peace and Other Poems].\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:22:52\nI usually translate the French, but I guess here I don't really have to. I'll read a...the French is very banal, it means, \"In my Provence the wheat is always green, the girls are pretty, they love me madly, they never die in my Provence\". This poem is called \"Great Beauty\". \n \nKenneth Koch\n00:23:14\nReads \"Great Beauty\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:23:31\nThis poem is called \"Little Known Historical Fact\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:23:35\nReads \"Little Known Historical Fact\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:23:48\nCharlemagne [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3044] is an Italian. [Audience laughter]. This is called...\"Getting Back on Land\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:24:06\nReads \"Getting Back on Land\".\n \nAudience\n00:24:22\nLaughter. \n \nKenneth Koch\n00:24:29\nThis, the next thing I want to read is part of a long poem I've been writing in the last year. George [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1239280] mentioned an epic poem I wrote called \u201cKo\u201d, which I wrote about, oh twelve or fourteen years ago, and it's a poem...that's \u201cKo\u201d, there it is, and it's about a hundred and twenty pages, it's in ottava rima, which is a stanza that Ariosto [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q48900] used in Orlando Furioso [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q48922] and it's also the stanza that Byron [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5679] used in Don Juan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1245187]. It rhymes ABABABCC. And...I really like \u201cKo\u201d a lot. It's a poem about a, the main character is a Japanese baseball player, a pitcher, who throws the ball so hard he knocks the grandstand down with every pitch. And there are a lot of other characters in it. When I wrote the poem I really was very happy, I was living in Florence [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2044], in a villino, and, sort of outside of town on the Viale Michelangelo, and what I tried to do in \u201cKo\u201d is like to put in every pleasant thing I'd ever experienced in my life, and the poem is kind of happy and optimistic. And I always wanted to continue it, because I liked writing that way. And I never could, because the continuation was always sort of in the style of \u201cKo\u201d exactly and not as good. It sort of lost that particular feeling. Then I finally was able to start doing it again, recently, but I noticed as I went on writing the poem that it had changed a good deal, that my idea about life and the world was not quite the same, naturally, partly because it changes in me, and partly because it changes in the world, but I don't want to get into metaphysical questions. In any case, the first thing I want to read from this poem is the, like the \u201cPrologue\u201d, which explains my problems in continuing this very happy poem fourteen years afterwards. The only, I think the only thing that needs explaining that I haven't explained is that \u201cKo\u201d ends with the line, \"Huddle, meanwhile, was flaking at the knees.\" Now Huddle is a, like an Englishman in \u201cKo\u201d who dies of mold fever in Rome [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q220], and when he dies he turns into a statue which is set up near the Villa Giulia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q964499] in Rome. And all of the other characters that have been killed sort of turn into statues and start coming back to life, and this is a sign that Huddle is coming back to life but he's flaking at the knees. In any case, that's referred to at the beginning of the \u201cPrologue\u201d.\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:27:00\nReads \"Prologue\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:34:08\nThat's the end of the \u201cPrologue\u201d. I want to read the first episode in the poem, now. I realize there was another, perhaps incomprehensible thing in the \u201cPrologue\u201d. Pana Grady...Pana Grady's apartment was a place on...Central Park West [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2738041] where a lot of parties were held for Upper and Lower Bohemia in the days...well, it was about five or six years ago. Anyway. That's the end of the \u201cPrologue\u201d, which I'm not sure I'm finally going to attach to the poem, since I usually eliminate prologues. And this is the beginning of the poem. \n \nKenneth Koch\n00:34:55\nReads [\"Episode I\u201d].\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:41:07\nThat's the end of the first part. To tell you what happens in this poem would take as long as reading the whole poem, which I don't have time to do. I think I'd like to read some brief, improvisational plays. I wrote these plays to be done at The Living Theatre [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1202416], though I knew they wouldn't do them. Somebody asked me to write some improvisational plays, it's really, it's really great, you know, writes it with some actors that want to do it, and I'd, I'd seen some improvisational plays and it seemed to me that the only emotions that actors could improvise were...let's see, passion, nostalgia, self-hatred, anxiety, and then make narcissism and then make topical references, and I decide to really throw sort of a curve at actors and give them something that would really be hard to improvise. My penalty has been that these plays have never been done. The first one I'd like to read...I'd be very glad if they were, could be given a premiere here in Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16]. \"Mexico City\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:42:18\nReads \"Mexico City\" [published later in A Change of Hearts: Plays, Films, and Other Dramatic Works 1951-1971].\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:43:13\nThe next one is called \"The Lost Feed\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:43:16\nReads \"The Lost Feed\" [published later in A Change of Hearts: Plays, Films, and Other Dramatic Works 1951-1971].\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:44:12\nThe next play is called \"Coil Supreme\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:44:17\nReads \"Coil Supreme\" [published later in A Change of Hearts: Plays, Films, and Other Dramatic Works 1951-1971].\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:44:48\nThe last improvisational play I'll read is the one that has always moved me the most at the thought of production. It's called \"The Gold Standard\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:44:57\nReads \"The Gold Standard\" [published later in A Change of Hearts: Plays, Films, and Other Dramatic Works 1951-1971].\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:45:54\nI think I'd like to read a rather long poem called...my present plan, which--I don't want to really ruin people's evening, since I didn't start until 9:30, I think the poems that I would like to read will last until 11. So, it's twenty-five after ten now, I don't want to keep anybody up to late or anything. [Audience laughter]. If...Don't feel bad about leaving if you have to go, I want to read these two rather long poems. This is called \"The Pleasures of Peace\". I should say something about this poem, I wrote it...I started to write it, oh, three years ago, or whenever it was, maybe it was four years ago, but it took me a long time to write it. I guess about three years ago I started. It was at the moment of the, when there really was a lot of happiness in the peace movement in the United States. And it was like the first Peace Marches on Fifth Avenue, and people were jumping up and down for peace, and dancing for peace, and it really seemed as though what people were doing was going to do some good. And I remember feeling very excited in the first set of mass peace activities I was in because, being a poet, and having been brought up in America and everything and like almost all the other poets and artists I knew I sort of felt like a social outcast a little bit. And then I found, in the midst of the peace movement, like there were hundreds of thousands of people who sort of felt the same way about a lot of things, it was nice. And there was something very sort of grand and exciting about the peace movement which does not have anything to do with the issues at all, it was just a lot of fun. In a way it was sort of...it was very pleasant. There were a few other things that motivated this poem. One was I was very annoyed at a lot of my fellow-poets who were going around, giving, in groups to colleges, giving poetry readings for peace. Now there were two things about this that annoyed me, three things. One was that I wasn't doing it. But that, I think, was a minor thing  A second thing was that...who did they really think they were trying to convert, like college students who came to poetry readings? I mean, college students who come to poetry readings are not usually in favour of war. And in the second-place, all the poems they read for peace were the sort of things that would make you want to go out and kill people, like \"Lyndon Johnson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q9640], you, fuck the pregnant woman who's lying with her guts streaming out,\" [audience laughter] and they weren't, they didn't really...they didn't really seem like peace poems to me. It...And I felt it was sort of exploitative on their part to do that. So I wanted to write a--I'd never written a political poem and I wanted very much to write a poem, I had very strong feelings about the Vietnam War [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q8740], and I wanted to write a poem against the war but which really, was really a poem, a positive poem about peace. I found it terribly hard to do, and I never worked so long on any poem. The fact that I worked so long on it does not mean that it's any better than anything else I ever wrote, but it was just hard, because I kept trying to put in sort of, things about suffering and so on, and they would jump out of the poem the way an artificial heart, I mean the way a transferred heart is sometimes rejected by the body. And I realized I was sort of stuck with writing a poem that was, like, one of my poems, it was really sort of a positive poem about peace. Another problem is that if you write a poem about the pleasures of peace it means you're writing a poem about the pleasures of life. And it's endless, in any case. That's about enough of that for now. It took me over a year to write, it was mainly the last part I couldn't write, since I didn't want to have sort of a literary copout at the end, and I didn't want to sort of end up, oh well, anyway. It's just a poem. The only thing--I got varied reactions to the poem. One...some dopey poet friend of mine came over and said, \"Boy, you really put the peace movement down\". And I haven't spoken to him very much since then. But then, a better reaction was that I got, some guy called me up and asked me if he could use this poem as his draft resistance statement. And I said you're going to languish in prison for a long time because, you know, judges don't like poetry. But anyway. Now just forget everything I've said [audience laughter] and I'll read this poem. And there's a pause. \"The Pleasures of Peace\". Oh! Another thing. [Audience laughter]. I read this poem in London [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q84] last year, and I got this dopey review in the Times [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q50008] by, who was it....I'm not sure. And he said, \"Kenneth Koch's 'Pleasures of Peace' is a very interesting poem but since he mentions the name of all his friends which we can't be expected to know\u201d--like about 90% of the people in this poem are imaginary. They, they're not my friends. [Audience laughter]. Okay. Like Georgio Finogo is not a real person, okay?. \"The Pleasures of Peace\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:51:15\nReads \"The Pleasures of Peace\" [from The Pleasures of Peace and Other Poems].\n \nAudience\n01:11:09\nApplause. \n \nKenneth Koch\n01:11:15\nThank you. \n \nKenneth Koch\n01:11:22\nI want to read another poem which will take about seven minutes, but just to rest up I'll read a short poem...I can't find one short enough...Oh, this is called \"An X-Ray of Utah\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n01:12:00\nReads \"An X-Ray of Utah\" [from The Pleasures of Peace and Other Poems].\n \nKenneth Koch\n01:12:08\nWell that's the shortest poem I ever wrote. [Audience laughter]. Except, there's one that's not in any of my books which is called \"Tennis\", which is the same length. \n \nKenneth Koch\n01:12:19\nReads \"Tennis\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n01:12:29\nOh, I think I'll read a few movie scripts. I'll just read a few. This is really for, this is from something called \"Ten Films\", but I'll just read a few of them, which are my favourites. One of the films is called \"Sheep Harbour\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n01:12:44\nReads \"Sheep Harbour\" [published later in A Change of Hearts: Plays, Films, and Other Dramatic Works 1951-1971].\n \nKenneth Koch\n01:12:57\nLike, the camera could sort of show this for a long time.\n \nKenneth Koch\n01:13:03\nReads \"Oval Gold\" [published later in A Change of Hearts: Plays, Films, and Other Dramatic Works 1951-1971].\n \nKenneth Koch\n01:13:19\nI'll just read one more of these films. This is called \"The Cemetery\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n01:13:24\nReads \"The Cemetery\" [published later in A Change of Hearts: Plays, Films, and Other Dramatic Works 1951-1971].\n \nKenneth Koch\n01:13:49\nI'll read this one last poem which is called \"Sleeping with Women\u201d.  \"Sleeping with Women\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n01:13:54\nReads \"Sleeping with Women\" [from The Pleasures of Peace and Other Poems].\n\nEND\n01:22:37\n"

In 1943, after completing high school, Koch served in the United States Army until 1945. He then enrolled at Harvard University, and received his B.A. degree in 1948 in English literature and writing. Koch then entered the Ph.D. program at Columbia University in New York City, through which he traveled on a Fulbright scholarship to France to study avant-garde poetry. In New York, he met poets John Ashbery and Frank O\u2019Hara, the three of whom would be coined the New York School of Poets. Koch published his first collection of poetry, Poems (Tibor de Nagy Gallery, 1953), and wrote a play, Little Red Riding Hood (1953), followed by Ko; or, A Season on Earth (Grove Press, 1959).  During this time Koch taught at Rutgers and Brooklyn Colleges before he completed his Ph.D. in 1959. Koch\u2019s second play, Bertha, debuted in 1960, along with a third collection of poetry, Permanently (Tiber Press, 1960). In the early 60\u2019s, Koch published plays, including George Washington Crossing the Delaware, The Construction of Boston (both in 1962), Guinevere; or, The Death of the Kangaroo, (1964). Koch was also a brilliant teacher, creating poetry and reading programs for grade school students in New York City public schools, which he won a Harbison Award for teaching. He published his experiences in Wishes, Lies and Dreams: Teaching Children to Write Poetry (Chelsea House, 1970) and Rose, Where Did You Get That Red?: Teaching Great Poetry to Children (Random House, 1973), which won a Ohioana Book Award and a Christopher Book Award. He also launched a similar program for the elderly, as described in I Never Told Anybody: Teaching Poetry Writing in a Nursing Home (Random House, 1977). During this time Koch published numerous books of verse, namely The Pleasures of Peace and Other Poems (Grove Press, 1969), When the Sun Tries to Go On (Black Sparrow, 1969), Sleeping with Women (Black Sparrow Press, 1969), the highly praised The Art of Love (Random House, 1975) which won the National Institute of Arts and Letters award in 1976, The Burning Mystery of Anna in 1951 (Random House, 1979). A prolific writer, Koch wrote over forty books and plays, including Days and Nights (Random House, 1982), On the Edge (Alfred A. Knopf, 1986) which won an Award of Merit for Poetry from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, Selected Poems, 1950-1982 (Random House, 1985), a book of short dramatic selections One Thousand Avant-garde Plays (Knopf, 1988) won a National Book Critic\u2019s Circle nomination, Selected Poems, (Carcanet, 1991), On the Great Atlantic Rainway: Selected Poems, 1950-1988 (Knopf, 1994) and his last book, New Addresses (Knopf, 2000). 1995 was a big year for Koch, as he was awarded the Bollingen Prize for a lifetime achievement to poetry, and was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Subsequently, Koch received the Rebekah Johnson Bobbitt National Prize for Poetry in 1996, the Chevalier de l\u2019ordre des arts et des lettres in France in 1999, and the Phi Beta Kappa Poetry Award. Kenneth Koch died of leukemia on July 6, 2002 in New York City."

Those that have been involved in reading American poetry over the past few years will naturally know who Kenneth Koch is, that he along with Frank O'Hara [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q951010] probably invented modern American poetry in New York City [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60], and it's, and he's also been in the news lately in the various, Slick magazine in the United States [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30] as a teacher of poetry, a very important teacher of poetry to kids in schools. And he's the only man I know who's been able to write what I think is probably an epic in the American language. So I'd like to make this as fast as I can and introduce Mr. Kenneth Koch.\n \nAudience\n00:00:58\nApplause.\n \nUnknown\n00:01:03\n[Cut or edit in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:01:04\nThe first poem I'll read is called \"Spring\". \n \nKenneth Koch\n00:01:08\nReads \"Spring\" [from Thank You and Other Poems].\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:02:36\nThe next poem I want to read is called \"Variations on a Theme by William Carlos Williams\". I love Williams' [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q178106] work, and I usually only write parodies of people whose work I like a lot. This parody is based on a poem of Williams, well, actually, on a certain characteristic I saw in Williams' work for a long time which I like, which is sort of, the idea that if you really like something enough and if you want to do it enough, it's okay to do it. And I saw certain insane possibilities of this viewpoint. This is specifically a parody of a poem which goes, \"This is just to say I've eaten the plums in the icebox and which you were probably saving for breakfast. Forgive me, they were so cold and so delicious\". It's really a nice poem, but it seemed to me there was a little streak of insanity running through it. It's called, \"Variations on a Theme by William Carlos Williams\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:03:28\nReads \"Variations on a Theme by William Carlos Williams\" [from Thank You and Other Poems].\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:04:33\nI'd like to read another short poem, this is called \"You Were Wearing\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:04:38\nReads \"You Were Wearing\" [from Thank You and Other Poems].\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:06:37\nI'm trying to find the ideal lights still, it\u2019s--okay, I think that's probably a bit better. The next thing that I want to read is a play called \"E.KOLOGY\". It's...E.KOLOGY is the name of the hero, it's like capital \"E,\" period, capital \"KOLOGY.\" I'd like to say something about this play. I read it at the University of Chicago [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q131252] last year, and some students thought that I was making fun of the ecology movement. I'm not, and I would see to it that if it were produced that that was not the case. It just seemed to me that the ecology movement was such a, like a natural cause for pleasure that it wouldn't really do to be totally solemn about it. The, I wrote this to be performed on Earth Day [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q124473], in New York last year in April, but they were supposed to have all these things in Union Square [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q110007] and it just ended up being a lot of light shows and speeches, I think, because they couldn't get the actors together and the lights and the stage and everything. It was done in Philadelphia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1345], did anyone see it, by any chance? Probably not. I didn't see it. I didn't even know it was done. In any case. E.KOLOGY. \n \nKenneth Koch\n00:07:44\nReads E.KOLOGY - Act One, Scene One [published later in A Change of Hearts: Plays, Films, and Other Dramatic Works 1951-1971].\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:09:38\nReads E.KOLOGY - Act One, Scene Two [published later in A Change of Hearts: Plays, Films, and Other Dramatic Works 1951-1971].\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:11:19\nReads E.KOLOGY - Act One, Scene Three [published later in A Change of Hearts: Plays, Films, and Other Dramatic Works 1951-1971].\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:12:06\nReads E.KOLOGY - Act Two [published later in A Change of Hearts: Plays, Films, and Other Dramatic Works 1951-1971].\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:13:54\nReads E.KOLOGY - Act Three, Scene One [published later in A Change of Hearts: Plays, Films, and Other Dramatic Works 1951-1971].\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:14:24\nReads E.KOLGOY - Act Three, Scene Two [published later in A Change of Hearts: Plays, Films, and Other Dramatic Works 1951-1971].\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:16:04\nReads E.KOLOGY - Act Four [published later in A Change of Hearts: Plays, Films, and Other Dramatic Works 1951-1971].\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:17:30\nReads E.KOLOGY - Act Five [published later in A Change of Hearts: Plays, Films, and Other Dramatic Works 1951-1971].\n \nAudience\n00:19:34\nApplause.\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:19:44\nWhile you're in the mood for theatre, I'll read a film script I wrote which I'd be delighted if someone would do. No one's ever done it. Apparently it would cost a great deal to do this, although it's very simple. It's called \u201cYouth\u201d.\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:19:57\nReads \"Youth\" [published later in A Change of Hearts: Plays, Films, and Other Dramatic Works 1951-1971].\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:21:36\nI don't hear any takers unless...Let's see. This is a very short poem called, \"Poem\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:21:53\nReads \"Poem\" [from The Pleasures of Peace and Other Poems].\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:22:11\nThis, this poem is called \"Ma Provence\", and my interest in writing it was the different way that French and English sound to me. \"Ma Provence\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:22:23\nReads \"Ma Provence\" [from The Pleasures of Peace and Other Poems].\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:22:52\nI usually translate the French, but I guess here I don't really have to. I'll read a...the French is very banal, it means, \"In my Provence the wheat is always green, the girls are pretty, they love me madly, they never die in my Provence\". This poem is called \"Great Beauty\". \n \nKenneth Koch\n00:23:14\nReads \"Great Beauty\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:23:31\nThis poem is called \"Little Known Historical Fact\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:23:35\nReads \"Little Known Historical Fact\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:23:48\nCharlemagne [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3044] is an Italian. [Audience laughter]. This is called...\"Getting Back on Land\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:24:06\nReads \"Getting Back on Land\".\n \nAudience\n00:24:22\nLaughter. \n \nKenneth Koch\n00:24:29\nThis, the next thing I want to read is part of a long poem I've been writing in the last year. George [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1239280] mentioned an epic poem I wrote called \u201cKo\u201d, which I wrote about, oh twelve or fourteen years ago, and it's a poem...that's \u201cKo\u201d, there it is, and it's about a hundred and twenty pages, it's in ottava rima, which is a stanza that Ariosto [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q48900] used in Orlando Furioso [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q48922] and it's also the stanza that Byron [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5679] used in Don Juan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1245187]. It rhymes ABABABCC. And...I really like \u201cKo\u201d a lot. It's a poem about a, the main character is a Japanese baseball player, a pitcher, who throws the ball so hard he knocks the grandstand down with every pitch. And there are a lot of other characters in it. When I wrote the poem I really was very happy, I was living in Florence [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2044], in a villino, and, sort of outside of town on the Viale Michelangelo, and what I tried to do in \u201cKo\u201d is like to put in every pleasant thing I'd ever experienced in my life, and the poem is kind of happy and optimistic. And I always wanted to continue it, because I liked writing that way. And I never could, because the continuation was always sort of in the style of \u201cKo\u201d exactly and not as good. It sort of lost that particular feeling. Then I finally was able to start doing it again, recently, but I noticed as I went on writing the poem that it had changed a good deal, that my idea about life and the world was not quite the same, naturally, partly because it changes in me, and partly because it changes in the world, but I don't want to get into metaphysical questions. In any case, the first thing I want to read from this poem is the, like the \u201cPrologue\u201d, which explains my problems in continuing this very happy poem fourteen years afterwards. The only, I think the only thing that needs explaining that I haven't explained is that \u201cKo\u201d ends with the line, \"Huddle, meanwhile, was flaking at the knees.\" Now Huddle is a, like an Englishman in \u201cKo\u201d who dies of mold fever in Rome [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q220], and when he dies he turns into a statue which is set up near the Villa Giulia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q964499] in Rome. And all of the other characters that have been killed sort of turn into statues and start coming back to life, and this is a sign that Huddle is coming back to life but he's flaking at the knees. In any case, that's referred to at the beginning of the \u201cPrologue\u201d.\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:27:00\nReads \"Prologue\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:34:08\nThat's the end of the \u201cPrologue\u201d. I want to read the first episode in the poem, now. I realize there was another, perhaps incomprehensible thing in the \u201cPrologue\u201d. Pana Grady...Pana Grady's apartment was a place on...Central Park West [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2738041] where a lot of parties were held for Upper and Lower Bohemia in the days...well, it was about five or six years ago. Anyway. That's the end of the \u201cPrologue\u201d, which I'm not sure I'm finally going to attach to the poem, since I usually eliminate prologues. And this is the beginning of the poem. \n \nKenneth Koch\n00:34:55\nReads [\"Episode I\u201d].\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:41:07\nThat's the end of the first part. To tell you what happens in this poem would take as long as reading the whole poem, which I don't have time to do. I think I'd like to read some brief, improvisational plays. I wrote these plays to be done at The Living Theatre [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1202416], though I knew they wouldn't do them. Somebody asked me to write some improvisational plays, it's really, it's really great, you know, writes it with some actors that want to do it, and I'd, I'd seen some improvisational plays and it seemed to me that the only emotions that actors could improvise were...let's see, passion, nostalgia, self-hatred, anxiety, and then make narcissism and then make topical references, and I decide to really throw sort of a curve at actors and give them something that would really be hard to improvise. My penalty has been that these plays have never been done. The first one I'd like to read...I'd be very glad if they were, could be given a premiere here in Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16]. \"Mexico City\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:42:18\nReads \"Mexico City\" [published later in A Change of Hearts: Plays, Films, and Other Dramatic Works 1951-1971].\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:43:13\nThe next one is called \"The Lost Feed\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:43:16\nReads \"The Lost Feed\" [published later in A Change of Hearts: Plays, Films, and Other Dramatic Works 1951-1971].\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:44:12\nThe next play is called \"Coil Supreme\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:44:17\nReads \"Coil Supreme\" [published later in A Change of Hearts: Plays, Films, and Other Dramatic Works 1951-1971].\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:44:48\nThe last improvisational play I'll read is the one that has always moved me the most at the thought of production. It's called \"The Gold Standard\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:44:57\nReads \"The Gold Standard\" [published later in A Change of Hearts: Plays, Films, and Other Dramatic Works 1951-1971].\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:45:54\nI think I'd like to read a rather long poem called...my present plan, which--I don't want to really ruin people's evening, since I didn't start until 9:30, I think the poems that I would like to read will last until 11. So, it's twenty-five after ten now, I don't want to keep anybody up to late or anything. [Audience laughter]. If...Don't feel bad about leaving if you have to go, I want to read these two rather long poems. This is called \"The Pleasures of Peace\". I should say something about this poem, I wrote it...I started to write it, oh, three years ago, or whenever it was, maybe it was four years ago, but it took me a long time to write it. I guess about three years ago I started. It was at the moment of the, when there really was a lot of happiness in the peace movement in the United States. And it was like the first Peace Marches on Fifth Avenue, and people were jumping up and down for peace, and dancing for peace, and it really seemed as though what people were doing was going to do some good. And I remember feeling very excited in the first set of mass peace activities I was in because, being a poet, and having been brought up in America and everything and like almost all the other poets and artists I knew I sort of felt like a social outcast a little bit. And then I found, in the midst of the peace movement, like there were hundreds of thousands of people who sort of felt the same way about a lot of things, it was nice. And there was something very sort of grand and exciting about the peace movement which does not have anything to do with the issues at all, it was just a lot of fun. In a way it was sort of...it was very pleasant. There were a few other things that motivated this poem. One was I was very annoyed at a lot of my fellow-poets who were going around, giving, in groups to colleges, giving poetry readings for peace. Now there were two things about this that annoyed me, three things. One was that I wasn't doing it. But that, I think, was a minor thing  A second thing was that...who did they really think they were trying to convert, like college students who came to poetry readings? I mean, college students who come to poetry readings are not usually in favour of war. And in the second-place, all the poems they read for peace were the sort of things that would make you want to go out and kill people, like \"Lyndon Johnson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q9640], you, fuck the pregnant woman who's lying with her guts streaming out,\" [audience laughter] and they weren't, they didn't really...they didn't really seem like peace poems to me. It...And I felt it was sort of exploitative on their part to do that. So I wanted to write a--I'd never written a political poem and I wanted very much to write a poem, I had very strong feelings about the Vietnam War [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q8740], and I wanted to write a poem against the war but which really, was really a poem, a positive poem about peace. I found it terribly hard to do, and I never worked so long on any poem. The fact that I worked so long on it does not mean that it's any better than anything else I ever wrote, but it was just hard, because I kept trying to put in sort of, things about suffering and so on, and they would jump out of the poem the way an artificial heart, I mean the way a transferred heart is sometimes rejected by the body. And I realized I was sort of stuck with writing a poem that was, like, one of my poems, it was really sort of a positive poem about peace. Another problem is that if you write a poem about the pleasures of peace it means you're writing a poem about the pleasures of life. And it's endless, in any case. That's about enough of that for now. It took me over a year to write, it was mainly the last part I couldn't write, since I didn't want to have sort of a literary copout at the end, and I didn't want to sort of end up, oh well, anyway. It's just a poem. The only thing--I got varied reactions to the poem. One...some dopey poet friend of mine came over and said, \"Boy, you really put the peace movement down\". And I haven't spoken to him very much since then. But then, a better reaction was that I got, some guy called me up and asked me if he could use this poem as his draft resistance statement. And I said you're going to languish in prison for a long time because, you know, judges don't like poetry. But anyway. Now just forget everything I've said [audience laughter] and I'll read this poem. And there's a pause. \"The Pleasures of Peace\". Oh! Another thing. [Audience laughter]. I read this poem in London [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q84] last year, and I got this dopey review in the Times [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q50008] by, who was it....I'm not sure. And he said, \"Kenneth Koch's 'Pleasures of Peace' is a very interesting poem but since he mentions the name of all his friends which we can't be expected to know\u201d--like about 90% of the people in this poem are imaginary. They, they're not my friends. [Audience laughter]. Okay. Like Georgio Finogo is not a real person, okay?. \"The Pleasures of Peace\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n00:51:15\nReads \"The Pleasures of Peace\" [from The Pleasures of Peace and Other Poems].\n \nAudience\n01:11:09\nApplause. \n \nKenneth Koch\n01:11:15\nThank you. \n \nKenneth Koch\n01:11:22\nI want to read another poem which will take about seven minutes, but just to rest up I'll read a short poem...I can't find one short enough...Oh, this is called \"An X-Ray of Utah\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n01:12:00\nReads \"An X-Ray of Utah\" [from The Pleasures of Peace and Other Poems].\n \nKenneth Koch\n01:12:08\nWell that's the shortest poem I ever wrote. [Audience laughter]. Except, there's one that's not in any of my books which is called \"Tennis\", which is the same length. \n \nKenneth Koch\n01:12:19\nReads \"Tennis\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n01:12:29\nOh, I think I'll read a few movie scripts. I'll just read a few. This is really for, this is from something called \"Ten Films\", but I'll just read a few of them, which are my favourites. One of the films is called \"Sheep Harbour\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n01:12:44\nReads \"Sheep Harbour\" [published later in A Change of Hearts: Plays, Films, and Other Dramatic Works 1951-1971].\n \nKenneth Koch\n01:12:57\nLike, the camera could sort of show this for a long time.\n \nKenneth Koch\n01:13:03\nReads \"Oval Gold\" [published later in A Change of Hearts: Plays, Films, and Other Dramatic Works 1951-1971].\n \nKenneth Koch\n01:13:19\nI'll just read one more of these films. This is called \"The Cemetery\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n01:13:24\nReads \"The Cemetery\" [published later in A Change of Hearts: Plays, Films, and Other Dramatic Works 1951-1971].\n \nKenneth Koch\n01:13:49\nI'll read this one last poem which is called \"Sleeping with Women\u201d.  \"Sleeping with Women\".\n \nKenneth Koch\n01:13:54\nReads \"Sleeping with Women\" [from The Pleasures of Peace and Other Poems].\n\nEND\n01:22:37\n",

            "contents": "gary_snyder_i006-11-106-1.mp3 [File 1 of 4]\n\nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:00:00\nProbably some of us are here in order to look at or touch the Gary Snyder [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q315963] who actually went and did all those semi-mythological things, who has climbed mountains and traveled in India with Allen Ginsberg [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6711], who provided Kerouac [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q160534] with a book character, who has lived in or on the edges of several different kinds of wilderness, who has lived in the precincts of Japanese Buddhist monasteries, who has fought, I think has fought hard, to keep other cultures than ours, and other kinds of life than human life, from obliteration. And who has written poems out of the consciousness of these things. For myself, Gary Snyder hasn't made poems so much as he has provided me with windows made out of words. These are windows that have had a way of, themselves disappearing, leaving me usually standing where I think I want to be, out in the open world. So, I came here, I've come here, to meet whoever it is that makes so many good windows. I'll let you discover for yourselves how much this window-maker is what a windowmaker should be, himself, just open and clear. I'd like to present Gary Snyder.\n\nGary Snyder\n00:02:58\nI forgot one more thing I wanted to have out here. Good evening. I'm going to read in two sets this evening, with a little intermission. And first of all, I'm not going to read any poems tonight from my published books, because those poems are available and what is interesting to me is always what I'm doing, where I'm moving. So I'm going to read from a cycle of short poems, moderately short poems, which I call \"Charms\", and\nthen there'll be a break, and then I'm going to read recent sections that I've been working on from a long poem in progress called \"Mountains and Rivers Without End\". I came back to the United States [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30] from Japan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q17] with my wife and children about three years ago now, and went as rapidly as possible to settle in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q26777], on the north slope of the south fork of the Yuba river [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q181973] at three-thousand foot elevation. And I've been living there for almost two years now. I'm saying this by way of introduction to this first cycle of poems called \"Charms\". I was brought up on a farm, and all of my ancestors that I know of, for the last few generations on both sides, were rural people, or miners, miners in Colorado [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1261], Leadville [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q286702], places like that. And it amazes me in a mysterious way how to get back to doing what my father was doing when I was a little boy, and what, and which I remember as a little boy, and to get back to doing what my grandfather was doing, which is to say--again, looking at the fences, looking at the stumps, looking at the house, looking at the well, looking at the spring and saying, how are we going to do it--touches me more deeply than I can possibly explain. And at the same time, being confronted again with these choices, which are the choices of the American frontier, and also the choices of medieval Europeans, and neolithic Mediterranean people, and neolithic Japanese people, and neolithic Chinese people. With what I've come to understand, a little more now, about history, anthropology, and biology, I feel an extraordinary responsibility to understand why I make the choices I make, in such matters as, where does one break the ground and locate a garden, or which trees does one select to fall. In other words, I find myself again in that position of entering virgin land, and this time, I want to understand, in the process of making my own choices, I want to understand why we did it wrong, every time before, and hope to get some insights in how one goes about doing it right, this time. In moving toward that understanding, in making the choices that I have to make, about how we are going to live, in the semi-wilderness and true wilderness of the Sierra Nevada, my teachers have to be scientific foresters, biologists and ecologists on the one hand, and the American Indians on the other. There are no other teachers available for these choices.\n\nGary Snyder\n00:08:02\nAnd so these poems, in the cycle called \"Charms\", reflect those debts and reflect the search for that knowledge, insofar as I've gotten into it up to this point. It starts with a little chant, called \"Grace for Love\". Before we...grace, in the sense of the grace that we say before meals. Which is, grace is gratitude, an expression of gratitude for a meal. And the gratitude that we say at my rancheria is a kind of a rough translation from a Japanese Buddhist grace which goes like this in English: \"We venerate the three treasures and are thankful for this meal, the work of other people, and the suffering of other forms of life.\" The need for grace, for love, is something I became aware of when I realized that there was a level of validity in the Catholic Church's objection to contraceptive devices, insofar as love, like food, is a sacrament, and that there is level in which the act of love should inevitably be connected with the consciousness of its role in moving the seed, in transmitting the energy of the knowledge of the biomass, as transmitted down through time. But I felt that the church is far too simple-minded in assuming that the energy aroused in the sacrament of love, in the direction of fertility, has to mean literally that the people who are acting that sacrament out have to necessarily procreate their own kind. And so we came to this, I and several other people, came to this, as what primitive people would call the transferral of merit, or species-increase ritual. In other words, we make love with gratitude to other beings, and wish to transfer our fertility from the human race to the vanishing species.\n\nGary Snyder\n00:11:09\nPerforms \"Grace for Love\".\n\nGary Snyder\n00:14:20\nReads \"A Curse on the Man In the Pentagon, Washington\".\n\nGary Snyder\n00:16:37\nThat's from a Cheyenne ghost dance song, that little last chorus.\n\nGary Snyder\n00:16:43\nReads \"I went into the Maverick Bar\" [published later  in Turtle Island].\n\nGary Snyder\n00:18:25\nThe Navajo word \"Anasazi\" means \"the ancient ones.\" It's the name that the Navajo gave to the people who lived in the canyons and cliffs of Chaco Canyon [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q49786970] and Canyon De Chelly [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q41679118] and Mesa Verde [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6821095] and many other sites. Probably the people were the ancestors of the present Pueblo people, living there probably up until the twelfth century, till the great drought of the thirteenth century. The people who more than any others, to judge from what the Pueblo people are still able to transmit today, the people who more than any others have achieved what could truly be called \"civilization\" on this continent, and whose lore embodies perhaps two millennia of deep experience. I wrote this at Canyon De Chelly.\n\nGary Snyder\n00:19:52\nReads \u201cAnasazi\u201d [published later in Turtle Island].\n\nGary Snyder\n00:21:11\nThe Canyon De Chelly, which will come up in another poem I'm going to read later today, and in fact, all over the West, all over the Great Basin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q966943], and in other parts of North America [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q49] too, notably on the granite outcroppings on th]e northern shores of Lake Superior [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1066], for example, are designs pecked into the rocks, petroglyphs. Anthropologists, Americanists, whatever you call 'em, haven't had much time to study those petroglyphs yet, because they've been engaged through all the years of this century in a hasty, half-successful salvage operation. Salvaging the remnants of this or that dying culture, recording and taping the last words of a dying language, and they've had no time to give to studying these older things that they know are there, such as the petroglyphs. But the petroglyphs have a repeated vocabulary of motifs which are found in patterns distributed all over North America, and particularly in the West. One of the most widespread is a hand, that someone has put on a cliff or a boulder face, apparently outlined, and then filled it in with red, hematite, or a red hand. That red hand often is lacking a finger, or lacking a finger-joint. This would not be notable in itself if it weren't that in the caves of southern France [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q142] and northern Spain [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q29], there are dated, back as far as 40,000 years, the same red hands, with missing fingers and missing finger-joints are found. This is only one of a number of things which are found all the way. And so this next poem, \"The Way West Underground\", is one of a number of poems, and this is perhaps the most intellectual of them, in which I'm trying to trace out how you get back to make the line of connection between what I know the American knows, what I am beginning to know the American Indian knew, and what I am beginning to know our prehistoric ancestors knew, which was not a different knowledge. And the question of why our prehistoric ancestors lost it is another question. Actually the main impetus of this poem deals with the bears, because there's an international mystery religion called the Bear Cult, that runs all the way from Finland [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q33] to Utah [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q829], across Siberia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5428], and it shares the mysterious central theme, which is a girl who marries a bear. I've written several poems about that girl. And about the bears. And so this is coming in on that from another angle.\n\nGary Snyder\n00:25:12\nReads \"The Way West Underground\" [published later in Turtle Island].\n\nEND\n00:26:55\n\n\ngary_snyder_i006-11-106-2.mp3 [File 2 of 4]\n\nGary Snyder\n00:00:00\n--which is a way Finnish men sing folk songs together.\n\nGary Snyder\n00:00:05\nResumes reading of \"The Way West Underground\".\n\nUnknown\n00:02:20\n[Cut or edit made in tape].\n\nGary Snyder\n00:02:21\nSo I had to trace back again in my mind, with my eyes, with my observation: of course, the plants produce seeds, the birds feed on the seeds, and so forth. Small members of the food chain. The ocean is similar but in a different set of relationships. We live on an exuberance of sexuality. We eat the reproductive organs of grasses: wheat, rice. Because herring or cod have millions of eggs that hatch into millions of almost-microscopic fry, the food chains of the ocean are made possible.\n\nGary Snyder\n00:03:16 \nReads \"The Song of the Taste\" from Regarding Wave.\n\nGary Snyder\n00:04:51\nI read that because it goes so nicely with this other poem, called \"Song to the Raw Material\". I really think a lot about these things these days because I've put myself deliberately in the position of having to know where my food comes from, and it's no longer a question of, like do I eat natural foods or supermarket foods, or do I eat meat or am I a vegetarian, it's more sophisticated than that, it's a lot more subtle than that. Like literally, where did it come from. And by what means can I have a sense of responsibility and gratitude to what it is that I'm eating and in what sense can I repay that world, whichever world it is, that I am feeding off of. Well of course one way you can repay it is by being a willing, and gracious, member of the food chain yourself. Now we are rather large animals, which means that we are rather high in the food chain. But nonetheless, quite edible. And it would be a great honour, really, to be eaten by a large, rare predator, and I can't think of any way I'd rather finish my days than to give myself to a grizzly bear, if I could, you know, choose when. [Laughter]. Like get all my affairs in order first. I'm not ready yet! Or at least, go back, as large creatures often do, go back into the cycle of feeding smaller creatures. But you can see the basic biological ignorance of this society, the ignorance of what systems really are, what basic systems are, and what our responsibilities to our membership in basic systems is, by the fact that they either burn people up or they fill them full of chemicals which make them not tasty, and lock them in bronze caskets, and so forth. The only people in the world who are righteous about this particular question seem to be the Tibetans and the Parsis, I mean, really righteous about it. The Tibetans and the Parsis have an old tradition, which is mentioned, it's so old that it's mentioned by Herodotus [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q11925546], in talking about a group of people called the Magi, in Persia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q794], that is to say they expose their dead in elevated places and feed them to the vultures. That's one very elegant way, actually, to deal with it. The Eskimo, an Eskimo shaman whose name I forget, is reputed to have said, \"We live dangerous lives, because our food consists entirely of souls\". \u201cSong to the Raw Material\u201d.\n\nGary Snyder\n00:08:12\nReads \"Song of the Raw Material\".\n\nGary Snyder\n00:09:12\nReads \"Steak\" [published later in Turtle Island; audience laughter and applause throughout].\n\nGary Snyder\n00:10:53\nI saw that in Lethbridge [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q270887], Alberta [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1951]. [Audience laughter]. The creation mythology of Japan, called the kojiki, is very long, and very complicated. I tried to boil it down to some kind of a formula I could understand, at least boil down the first hundred pages of it, so I wrote this--it's about how the world is created according to the Japanese creation mythology. I think. I think that's what it is.\n\nGary Snyder\n00:11:28\nReads \"No matter, never mind\" [published later in Turtle Island].\n\nAudience\n00:12:14\nLaughter and applause.\n\nGary Snyder\n00:12:24\nIt's funny how the language is smarter than we are, [audience laughter] yeah. Like we can get hung up on mind\/matter dualism, but the language won't accept it. It says the same thing two ways. \"The Bath\". Where we live we don't have any electricity or propane, and so we do everything with wood, including heating our bath, which we found the best wood-fired bathing system was a Finnish-type sauna, and...so this poem, you know just to set the scene, it's a somewhat longer poem, this poem is a sauna, with a wood-burning stove that also heats a tank of water on the side, and with a bench that you sit up on and a lower place that you can get down on and wash with. You can get these wood-fired sauna-stoves from some Finnish outfit in Michigan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1166]. The only place in the United States that I have been able to locate that makes sauna stoves that fire wood. I highly recommend them. The personae in this are my wife, my three-year old son, my three-and a-half year old son, my two-year-old son.\n\nGary Snyder\n00:14:00\nReads \"The Bath\" [published later in Turtle Island].\n\nGary Snyder\n00:19:31\nSome friends said to us, when we moved up to the backcountry, ah, you're just getting away from your responsibilities. You're evading the struggle. So I wrote this little poem as a, kind of a light answer to that. It's called \"Front Lines\".\n\nGary Snyder\n00:19:59\nReads \"Front Lines\" [published later in Turtle Island].\n\nGary Snyder\n00:21:36\nThat poem is not an exaggeration of what we're doing. We are, like, where I am and a number of other people I know around this continent, have their backs up against the wilderness, so to speak, and they're not going to let this thing go past them. If they can help it, or as you say, over my dead body. The California Indians used to set control burns, as distinct from wildfires, forestry terms, which contributed to the maintenance of what you might call a climax timber stand, keeping the undergrowth burnt out, keeping an annual deer-forage coming in, and protecting the large timber, as it were, from destructive forest fires, because whenever a forest fire--which is very common in California [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q99], it's an annual event--whenever forest fires go through, went through the forests when they were in that condition, it simply went through taking the ground cover off, but couldn't get hot enough or high enough to kill the large trees. With the advent of logging, mining, and the Manzanita brush that follows on that, the whole flora of California changed radically. All of the flora of California changed. What happened was that the woods got very brushy, and then the early forestry practices which were, of course, to put forest fires out whenever they came on them, in some ways contributed to the increasingly dangerous situation of dense brush, logging slash laying around, second-growth trees not really very large yet, and a situation where every brush fire that went through killed absolutely everything grew up. And that's the state of the state now, to a large extent, although there are some hip foresters now who are back into control burns as best as they can. This poem is called \"Control Burn\" and it only starts from what I'm just talking about, taking that as an image.\n\nGary Snyder\n00:24:00\nReads \"Control Burn\" [published later in Turtle Island].\n\nGary Snyder\n00:25:37\nReads \"The Great Mother\" [published later in Turtle Island].\n\nEND\n00:26:55\n\n\ngary_snyder_i006-11-106-3.mp3 [File 3 of 4]\n\nGary Snyder\n00:00:00\nEverything in this next poem is all true.

[Laughter].\n \nAudience Member 2\n00:11:58\nNo no no, no really, no really, I don't know too much about...Gary Snyder, you know?\n \nGary Snyder\n00:12:04\nWell, you'd probably find, I don't know, because I'm coming here, because of my being here now, they've probably got some of my books in the bookstore, if you want to go look. [Laughter].\n \nAudience Member 2\n00:12:13\nSee I'm writing this play right now, you know? I'm trying to express myself and it's really...it's really strange [Cut off abruptly].\n \nUnknown\n00:12:27\n[Cut or edit in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n \nGary Snyder\n00:12:28\nWell, there has been a great deal of opposition to nuclear energy, and nuclear power-generating stations, in the United States so effective in some areas that a lot of generating plants have been blocked or slowed down in their construction. And I think that the United States government is about to launch on an enormous effort to calm the public and to lull it into accepting massive developments of nuclear energy generating centres, fast-breeder and later, perhaps, fusion. Now I myself would have no objection to such a thing if I could be convinced that it was safe, both in the long term and the short term, and although it might be conceivably safe in the short term, I can see no way in which it would be safe in the long run, because nuclear wastes accumulated over, say, several centuries, as they might be, or more, in increasing quantities around the globe, are going to out eventually, and even though you can say, well, we're putting it off for five hundred thousand years, five hundred thousand years is not a very long time.  And if we are feeding a wasteful, industrial, technological, consumer society for a few more centuries, buying it a few more centuries of life, at the expense of all future biological health on the planet, it's obviously not worth it. The Amchitka test, which is possibly interested in such things as what uses very large explosions would have in releasing oil from oil-bearing shale or something like that, I think the U.S. administration is going ahead with this test in the face of all this criticism, deliberately, as a deliberate and very intelligent gamble. The chances are that nothing will happen. When nothing happens, then they will be able to say, \"All you people were hysterical. You see?  Nothing happened\".  And that will buy them a lot of time and a lot of credibility to proceed strongly and forcibly with more nuclear testing and more nuclear power generation development. And the conservationists, perhaps, have in a way, played into their hands, by making such a big issue out of it, so that they will be left holding an empty bag if nothing happens. If something does happen, then the administration can say, \"You're right, we were wrong\", and Nixon [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q9588] perhaps forfeits the next election. That's all. Okay. \n \nGary Snyder\n00:15:25.61\n\"Mountains and Rivers Without End\" is a poem that I've been working on, it's a long poem, a long series of interconnected long poems that I've been working on for some years. I'm going to read several sections from that tonight. Including one or two that are very recent, in fact these are all pretty recent. \"Mountains and Rivers without End\". The title of the poem comes from a Yuan Dynasty [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7313] Chinese scroll, that unfolds sideways and is thirty-five feet long. By way of introduction, a little poem called \"The Rabbit\". There are many sections to this, I'm only going to read [counts under breath.]..six tonight.\n \nGary Snyder\n00:16:27\nReads \"The Rabbit\" [published later in Mountains and Rivers Without End].\n \nGary Snyder\n00:18:04\n\"The California Water Plan\". The state of California at the moment is engaged in a large, incredibly wasteful, incredibly stupid, illegal, even by their own terms, water plan project, which if they're lucky, will salinate the Sacramento Valley [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1686914] and make agriculture permanently impossible. I was up in the Minarets [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2412852] in the Sierra last summer, thinking about the California Water Plan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q28228216], and I perceived something of what the true California Water Plan was. So I wrote this down. It refers to an obscure little Buddhist god called Fudo, or Achala [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q337624], who is my particular guardian, my personal guardian and my personal teacher, and, so I use, I refer to him, in several poems. The other two poems in which I refer to him actually are a piece called \"Smokey the Bear Sutra\", and another piece called \"Spell Against Demons\". This is the final, actually, this is the third and final poem in the trilogy of Fudo poems. Also. But you'll find all about Fudo in this poem, it'll drive you crazy.    \n \nGary Snyder\n00:19:48\nReads \"The California Water Plan\" [later published in The Fudo Trilogy].\n \nGary Snyder\n00:25:34\n\"Kumarajiva's Mother\". Now, the rest of these poems that I'm going to read this evening are cutting back and forth between ancient India [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q668] and ancient North America. I--living as I do and where I have lived all my life, we face the Pacific [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q98]. And, the American Indian came from Asia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q48], or vice versa, the Asians came from North America. I mean I know a Shoshone who says that. He says, \"We've always been here, those Asians came from here\". [Laughter].  \"What do you mean we came from someplace else, that's some white anthropologist theory\". [Laughter]. \"Kumarajiva's Mother.\" Kumarajiva [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q335293] was a great Buddhist monk-scholar-translator, who was kidnapped by the Chinese from Central Asia, by force, and carried off to China [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q148] where he was made to translate Sanskrit Buddhist texts into Chinese, and he stayed there the rest of his life, with a crew of about eighty Chinese assistants, day and night, translating sutras. He did a lot of translation. He also got in trouble, because he liked girls, and on one occasion, because he actually had mistresses apparently, he ate a bowl of needles, like you sew with needles, in front of an assembly of all the monks and assistants in Peking [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q956], or no it wasn't Peking in those days, it was Chang'an [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6501000], all of the monks and assistants in the capital, Chang'an, and then he said, \"When you boys can eat needles, you can have girlfriends too\". [Audience laughter]. But this poem is about his mother. [Audience laughter]. And I really, I mean I could explain to you why I wrote this poem but it isn't really worth explaining, I'll just read it. It has to do partly with the fact that my mother has freckles. And I was trying to figure out at this time, when I wrote this, I was trying to figure out whatever happened to women in Buddhism? Like something happened to 'em. They got lost. For a long time, anyway.\n \nGary Snyder\n00:28:22\nReads \"Kumarajiva's Mother\".\n \nEND\n00:30:59\n\n\ngary_snyder_i006-11-106-4.mp3 [File 4 of 4]\n \nGary Snyder\n00:00:00\n...alone in the 8th century, and studied at an enormous Buddhist, Mahayana university called Nalanda [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q216243], for fifteen years, and then walked back to China, with a fraying pack full of books, which he translated for the next twenty years after he got back to China. He brought the school of Buddhism, which is called the school of Mind Only, and the school of Emptiness. That's one aspect of this next poem. Another aspect is a little petroglyph, American Indian petroglyph figure, called the hump-backed flute player, a little stick figure playing the flute, with a pack on his back, walking. He was found pecked on the rocks from Sonora [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q46422], Mexico [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q96] up into the Great Basin, and about which almost nothing is known. The Ghost Dance, which was a Messianic Indian religion, started by a Paiute named Wovoka https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q558420], which asserted that perhaps by magic the white man could be swept away from North America and the game would return.  And finally, the oldest living beings are the bristle-coned pine, who live in the White Mountains [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1556007], at an elevation of nine thousand feet in eastern California, the oldest of which is something like four thousand five hundred years old. So this poem is called \"The Humpbacked Flute Player\".\n \nGary Snyder\n00:01:59\nReads \"The Humpbacked Flute Player\" from Coyote\u2019s Journal #9 [and published later in Mountains and Rivers Without End]. \n \nGary Snyder\n00:08:36\nI'm going to finish with one more poem called \"Down\". These poems are not in the order that they're going to be, but they're in a convenient order for the moment.\n \nGary Snyder\n00:09:05\nReads \"Down\".\n \nAudience\n00:11:48\nApplause.\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:12:18\nI can't thank you for that. I don't know any way. Charles Simic [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q722555] will be reading on November 19th. Thank you. \n\nAudience\n00:12:40 \nApplause.\n\nEND\n00:12:45\n"

                "notes": "American poet and nature activist Gary Snyder was born in San Francisco on May 8, 1930. He spent most of his early life exploring the wilderness and cultures along the Pacific Coast around his parent\u2019s dairy farm in Washington State. In 1942, his family moved to Portland, Oregon and in 1947 he enrolled in Reed College to study literature and anthropology. His senior thesis was later published in 1978 and called He Who Hunted Birds in His Father\u2019s Village: The Dimensions of a Haida Myth (Grey Fox Press). Snyder then worked various jobs with the U.S. Forest Service and Park Service, with timber companies on Native American Reservations, and Snyder even climbed aboard a ship traveling to South America. In 1951, Snyder completed his bachelor\u2019s degree and went to Indiana University to study linguistics, which only lasted one semester, after which, he traveled to San Francisco. Snyder met and lived with the poet Philip Whalen before entering into the University of California, Berkley in 1952 to begin graduate studies in East Asian languages. The poetry scene in San Francisco (San Francisco Renaissance) had begun to take shape and on October 7, 1955, Snyder read with Allen Ginsberg, Philip Lamantia, Michael McClure, Kenneth Rexroth and Philip Whalen at the famous \u201cSix Poets at the Six Gallery\u201d, a reading which launched the \u2018Beat\u2019 movement. In 1956, Snyder began formal Buddhist training in Kyoto, Japan, and traveled back and forth from the U.S. several times during the next decade, studying Buddhism and writing poetry. Snyder\u2019s first collection of poetry was Riprap (Four Seasons Foundation, 1959), which was followed the next year by Myths and Texts (Totem Press, 1960), Six Sections from Mountains and Rivers without End (1965), Cold Mountain Poems (Four Seasons, 1965), The Back Country (New Directions, 1968), a collection of essays Earth House Hold (New Directions, 1969), Regarding Wave (Windhover Press, 1969), Manzanita (Four Seasons Foundation, 1972), The Fudo Trilogy (Shaman Drum, 1973) and the Pulitzer Prize-winning Turtle Island (New Directions, 1974). With an increase in popularity, Snyder became a spokesman for environmental issues and served on the Board for the California Arts Council between 1974 and 1979. He began local projects and schools, including the North San Juan School House and the Ring-of-Bone Zendo Buddhist community centre. Snyder then published a series of essays and prose in The Old Ways (City Lights Books, 1977), The Real Work: Interviews and Talks, 1964-1979 (New Directions, 1980), and an account of his travels with poets Joanne Kyger and Allen Ginsberg Passage through India (1983), and a return to poetry with Axe Handles (North Point Press, 1983), and Left Out in the Rain (North Point Press, 1986). Snyder then began teaching at the University of California, Davis, in both the English and Nature and Culture Departments. More recently, he has published essays and poetry in No Nature: New and Selected Poems (Pantheon Books, 1992), a completed version of a long poem previously published Mountains and Rivers without End (Counterpoint, 1996) which won the Bollingen Prize. His collected poetry can be found in The Gary Snyder Reader: Prose, Poetry and Translations 1952-1998 (Counterpoint, 1999) and The High Sierra of California: Poems and Journals of Gary Snyder (Quail Press, 2000). Snyder retired from teaching in 2002, but has continued advocating for environmental issues and writing poetry, publishing Danger on Peaks (Shoemaker & Hoard, 2004), Back on the Fire: Essays (Shoemaker & Hoard, 2007)."

And who has written poems out of the consciousness of these things. For myself, Gary Snyder hasn't made poems so much as he has provided me with windows made out of words. These are windows that have had a way of, themselves disappearing, leaving me usually standing where I think I want to be, out in the open world. So, I came here, I've come here, to meet whoever it is that makes so many good windows. I'll let you discover for yourselves how much this window-maker is what a windowmaker should be, himself, just open and clear. I'd like to present Gary Snyder.\n\nGary Snyder\n00:02:58\nI forgot one more thing I wanted to have out here. Good evening. I'm going to read in two sets this evening, with a little intermission. And first of all, I'm not going to read any poems tonight from my published books, because those poems are available and what is interesting to me is always what I'm doing, where I'm moving. So I'm going to read from a cycle of short poems, moderately short poems, which I call \"Charms\", and\nthen there'll be a break, and then I'm going to read recent sections that I've been working on from a long poem in progress called \"Mountains and Rivers Without End\". I came back to the United States [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30] from Japan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q17] with my wife and children about three years ago now, and went as rapidly as possible to settle in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q26777], on the north slope of the south fork of the Yuba river [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q181973] at three-thousand foot elevation. And I've been living there for almost two years now. I'm saying this by way of introduction to this first cycle of poems called \"Charms\". I was brought up on a farm, and all of my ancestors that I know of, for the last few generations on both sides, were rural people, or miners, miners in Colorado [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1261], Leadville [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q286702], places like that. And it amazes me in a mysterious way how to get back to doing what my father was doing when I was a little boy, and what, and which I remember as a little boy, and to get back to doing what my grandfather was doing, which is to say--again, looking at the fences, looking at the stumps, looking at the house, looking at the well, looking at the spring and saying, how are we going to do it--touches me more deeply than I can possibly explain. And at the same time, being confronted again with these choices, which are the choices of the American frontier, and also the choices of medieval Europeans, and neolithic Mediterranean people, and neolithic Japanese people, and neolithic Chinese people. With what I've come to understand, a little more now, about history, anthropology, and biology, I feel an extraordinary responsibility to understand why I make the choices I make, in such matters as, where does one break the ground and locate a garden, or which trees does one select to fall. In other words, I find myself again in that position of entering virgin land, and this time, I want to understand, in the process of making my own choices, I want to understand why we did it wrong, every time before, and hope to get some insights in how one goes about doing it right, this time. In moving toward that understanding, in making the choices that I have to make, about how we are going to live, in the semi-wilderness and true wilderness of the Sierra Nevada, my teachers have to be scientific foresters, biologists and ecologists on the one hand, and the American Indians on the other. There are no other teachers available for these choices.\n\nGary Snyder\n00:08:02\nAnd so these poems, in the cycle called \"Charms\", reflect those debts and reflect the search for that knowledge, insofar as I've gotten into it up to this point. It starts with a little chant, called \"Grace for Love\". Before we...grace, in the sense of the grace that we say before meals. Which is, grace is gratitude, an expression of gratitude for a meal. And the gratitude that we say at my rancheria is a kind of a rough translation from a Japanese Buddhist grace which goes like this in English: \"We venerate the three treasures and are thankful for this meal, the work of other people, and the suffering of other forms of life.\" The need for grace, for love, is something I became aware of when I realized that there was a level of validity in the Catholic Church's objection to contraceptive devices, insofar as love, like food, is a sacrament, and that there is level in which the act of love should inevitably be connected with the consciousness of its role in moving the seed, in transmitting the energy of the knowledge of the biomass, as transmitted down through time. But I felt that the church is far too simple-minded in assuming that the energy aroused in the sacrament of love, in the direction of fertility, has to mean literally that the people who are acting that sacrament out have to necessarily procreate their own kind. And so we came to this, I and several other people, came to this, as what primitive people would call the transferral of merit, or species-increase ritual. In other words, we make love with gratitude to other beings, and wish to transfer our fertility from the human race to the vanishing species.\n\nGary Snyder\n00:11:09\nPerforms \"Grace for Love\".\n\nGary Snyder\n00:14:20\nReads \"A Curse on the Man In the Pentagon, Washington\".\n\nGary Snyder\n00:16:37\nThat's from a Cheyenne ghost dance song, that little last chorus.\n\nGary Snyder\n00:16:43\nReads \"I went into the Maverick Bar\" [published later  in Turtle Island].\n\nGary Snyder\n00:18:25\nThe Navajo word \"Anasazi\" means \"the ancient ones.\" It's the name that the Navajo gave to the people who lived in the canyons and cliffs of Chaco Canyon [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q49786970] and Canyon De Chelly [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q41679118] and Mesa Verde [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6821095] and many other sites. Probably the people were the ancestors of the present Pueblo people, living there probably up until the twelfth century, till the great drought of the thirteenth century. The people who more than any others, to judge from what the Pueblo people are still able to transmit today, the people who more than any others have achieved what could truly be called \"civilization\" on this continent, and whose lore embodies perhaps two millennia of deep experience. I wrote this at Canyon De Chelly.\n\nGary Snyder\n00:19:52\nReads \u201cAnasazi\u201d [published later in Turtle Island].\n\nGary Snyder\n00:21:11\nThe Canyon De Chelly, which will come up in another poem I'm going to read later today, and in fact, all over the West, all over the Great Basin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q966943], and in other parts of North America [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q49] too, notably on the granite outcroppings on th]e northern shores of Lake Superior [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1066], for example, are designs pecked into the rocks, petroglyphs. Anthropologists, Americanists, whatever you call 'em, haven't had much time to study those petroglyphs yet, because they've been engaged through all the years of this century in a hasty, half-successful salvage operation. Salvaging the remnants of this or that dying culture, recording and taping the last words of a dying language, and they've had no time to give to studying these older things that they know are there, such as the petroglyphs. But the petroglyphs have a repeated vocabulary of motifs which are found in patterns distributed all over North America, and particularly in the West. One of the most widespread is a hand, that someone has put on a cliff or a boulder face, apparently outlined, and then filled it in with red, hematite, or a red hand. That red hand often is lacking a finger, or lacking a finger-joint. This would not be notable in itself if it weren't that in the caves of southern France [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q142] and northern Spain [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q29], there are dated, back as far as 40,000 years, the same red hands, with missing fingers and missing finger-joints are found. This is only one of a number of things which are found all the way. And so this next poem, \"The Way West Underground\", is one of a number of poems, and this is perhaps the most intellectual of them, in which I'm trying to trace out how you get back to make the line of connection between what I know the American knows, what I am beginning to know the American Indian knew, and what I am beginning to know our prehistoric ancestors knew, which was not a different knowledge. And the question of why our prehistoric ancestors lost it is another question. Actually the main impetus of this poem deals with the bears, because there's an international mystery religion called the Bear Cult, that runs all the way from Finland [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q33] to Utah [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q829], across Siberia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5428], and it shares the mysterious central theme, which is a girl who marries a bear. I've written several poems about that girl. And about the bears. And so this is coming in on that from another angle.\n\nGary Snyder\n00:25:12\nReads \"The Way West Underground\" [published later in Turtle Island].\n\nEND\n00:26:55\n",

Small members of the food chain. The ocean is similar but in a different set of relationships. We live on an exuberance of sexuality. We eat the reproductive organs of grasses: wheat, rice. Because herring or cod have millions of eggs that hatch into millions of almost-microscopic fry, the food chains of the ocean are made possible.\n\nGary Snyder\n00:03:16 \nReads \"The Song of the Taste\" from Regarding Wave.\n\nGary Snyder\n00:04:51\nI read that because it goes so nicely with this other poem, called \"Song to the Raw Material\". I really think a lot about these things these days because I've put myself deliberately in the position of having to know where my food comes from, and it's no longer a question of, like do I eat natural foods or supermarket foods, or do I eat meat or am I a vegetarian, it's more sophisticated than that, it's a lot more subtle than that. Like literally, where did it come from. And by what means can I have a sense of responsibility and gratitude to what it is that I'm eating and in what sense can I repay that world, whichever world it is, that I am feeding off of. Well of course one way you can repay it is by being a willing, and gracious, member of the food chain yourself. Now we are rather large animals, which means that we are rather high in the food chain. But nonetheless, quite edible. And it would be a great honour, really, to be eaten by a large, rare predator, and I can't think of any way I'd rather finish my days than to give myself to a grizzly bear, if I could, you know, choose when. [Laughter]. Like get all my affairs in order first. I'm not ready yet! Or at least, go back, as large creatures often do, go back into the cycle of feeding smaller creatures. But you can see the basic biological ignorance of this society, the ignorance of what systems really are, what basic systems are, and what our responsibilities to our membership in basic systems is, by the fact that they either burn people up or they fill them full of chemicals which make them not tasty, and lock them in bronze caskets, and so forth. The only people in the world who are righteous about this particular question seem to be the Tibetans and the Parsis, I mean, really righteous about it. The Tibetans and the Parsis have an old tradition, which is mentioned, it's so old that it's mentioned by Herodotus [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q11925546], in talking about a group of people called the Magi, in Persia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q794], that is to say they expose their dead in elevated places and feed them to the vultures. That's one very elegant way, actually, to deal with it. The Eskimo, an Eskimo shaman whose name I forget, is reputed to have said, \"We live dangerous lives, because our food consists entirely of souls\". \u201cSong to the Raw Material\u201d.\n\nGary Snyder\n00:08:12\nReads \"Song of the Raw Material\".\n\nGary Snyder\n00:09:12\nReads \"Steak\" [published later in Turtle Island; audience laughter and applause throughout].\n\nGary Snyder\n00:10:53\nI saw that in Lethbridge [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q270887], Alberta [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1951]. [Audience laughter]. The creation mythology of Japan, called the kojiki, is very long, and very complicated. I tried to boil it down to some kind of a formula I could understand, at least boil down the first hundred pages of it, so I wrote this--it's about how the world is created according to the Japanese creation mythology. I think. I think that's what it is.\n\nGary Snyder\n00:11:28\nReads \"No matter, never mind\" [published later in Turtle Island].\n\nAudience\n00:12:14\nLaughter and applause.\n\nGary Snyder\n00:12:24\nIt's funny how the language is smarter than we are, [audience laughter] yeah. Like we can get hung up on mind\/matter dualism, but the language won't accept it. It says the same thing two ways. \"The Bath\". Where we live we don't have any electricity or propane, and so we do everything with wood, including heating our bath, which we found the best wood-fired bathing system was a Finnish-type sauna, and...so this poem, you know just to set the scene, it's a somewhat longer poem, this poem is a sauna, with a wood-burning stove that also heats a tank of water on the side, and with a bench that you sit up on and a lower place that you can get down on and wash with. You can get these wood-fired sauna-stoves from some Finnish outfit in Michigan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1166]. The only place in the United States that I have been able to locate that makes sauna stoves that fire wood. I highly recommend them. The personae in this are my wife, my three-year old son, my three-and a-half year old son, my two-year-old son.\n\nGary Snyder\n00:14:00\nReads \"The Bath\" [published later in Turtle Island].\n\nGary Snyder\n00:19:31\nSome friends said to us, when we moved up to the backcountry, ah, you're just getting away from your responsibilities. You're evading the struggle. So I wrote this little poem as a, kind of a light answer to that. It's called \"Front Lines\".\n\nGary Snyder\n00:19:59\nReads \"Front Lines\" [published later in Turtle Island].\n\nGary Snyder\n00:21:36\nThat poem is not an exaggeration of what we're doing. We are, like, where I am and a number of other people I know around this continent, have their backs up against the wilderness, so to speak, and they're not going to let this thing go past them. If they can help it, or as you say, over my dead body. The California Indians used to set control burns, as distinct from wildfires, forestry terms, which contributed to the maintenance of what you might call a climax timber stand, keeping the undergrowth burnt out, keeping an annual deer-forage coming in, and protecting the large timber, as it were, from destructive forest fires, because whenever a forest fire--which is very common in California [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q99], it's an annual event--whenever forest fires go through, went through the forests when they were in that condition, it simply went through taking the ground cover off, but couldn't get hot enough or high enough to kill the large trees. With the advent of logging, mining, and the Manzanita brush that follows on that, the whole flora of California changed radically. All of the flora of California changed. What happened was that the woods got very brushy, and then the early forestry practices which were, of course, to put forest fires out whenever they came on them, in some ways contributed to the increasingly dangerous situation of dense brush, logging slash laying around, second-growth trees not really very large yet, and a situation where every brush fire that went through killed absolutely everything grew up. And that's the state of the state now, to a large extent, although there are some hip foresters now who are back into control burns as best as they can. This poem is called \"Control Burn\" and it only starts from what I'm just talking about, taking that as an image.\n\nGary Snyder\n00:24:00\nReads \"Control Burn\" [published later in Turtle Island].\n\nGary Snyder\n00:25:37\nReads \"The Great Mother\" [published later in Turtle Island].\n\nEND\n00:26:55\n",

[Laughter].\n \nAudience Member 2\n00:12:13\nSee I'm writing this play right now, you know? I'm trying to express myself and it's really...it's really strange [Cut off abruptly].\n \nUnknown\n00:12:27\n[Cut or edit in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n \nGary Snyder\n00:12:28\nWell, there has been a great deal of opposition to nuclear energy, and nuclear power-generating stations, in the United States so effective in some areas that a lot of generating plants have been blocked or slowed down in their construction. And I think that the United States government is about to launch on an enormous effort to calm the public and to lull it into accepting massive developments of nuclear energy generating centres, fast-breeder and later, perhaps, fusion. Now I myself would have no objection to such a thing if I could be convinced that it was safe, both in the long term and the short term, and although it might be conceivably safe in the short term, I can see no way in which it would be safe in the long run, because nuclear wastes accumulated over, say, several centuries, as they might be, or more, in increasing quantities around the globe, are going to out eventually, and even though you can say, well, we're putting it off for five hundred thousand years, five hundred thousand years is not a very long time.  And if we are feeding a wasteful, industrial, technological, consumer society for a few more centuries, buying it a few more centuries of life, at the expense of all future biological health on the planet, it's obviously not worth it. The Amchitka test, which is possibly interested in such things as what uses very large explosions would have in releasing oil from oil-bearing shale or something like that, I think the U.S. administration is going ahead with this test in the face of all this criticism, deliberately, as a deliberate and very intelligent gamble. The chances are that nothing will happen. When nothing happens, then they will be able to say, \"All you people were hysterical. You see?  Nothing happened\".  And that will buy them a lot of time and a lot of credibility to proceed strongly and forcibly with more nuclear testing and more nuclear power generation development. And the conservationists, perhaps, have in a way, played into their hands, by making such a big issue out of it, so that they will be left holding an empty bag if nothing happens. If something does happen, then the administration can say, \"You're right, we were wrong\", and Nixon [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q9588] perhaps forfeits the next election. That's all. Okay. \n \nGary Snyder\n00:15:25.61\n\"Mountains and Rivers Without End\" is a poem that I've been working on, it's a long poem, a long series of interconnected long poems that I've been working on for some years. I'm going to read several sections from that tonight. Including one or two that are very recent, in fact these are all pretty recent. \"Mountains and Rivers without End\". The title of the poem comes from a Yuan Dynasty [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7313] Chinese scroll, that unfolds sideways and is thirty-five feet long. By way of introduction, a little poem called \"The Rabbit\". There are many sections to this, I'm only going to read [counts under breath.]..six tonight.\n \nGary Snyder\n00:16:27\nReads \"The Rabbit\" [published later in Mountains and Rivers Without End].\n \nGary Snyder\n00:18:04\n\"The California Water Plan\". The state of California at the moment is engaged in a large, incredibly wasteful, incredibly stupid, illegal, even by their own terms, water plan project, which if they're lucky, will salinate the Sacramento Valley [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1686914] and make agriculture permanently impossible. I was up in the Minarets [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2412852] in the Sierra last summer, thinking about the California Water Plan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q28228216], and I perceived something of what the true California Water Plan was. So I wrote this down. It refers to an obscure little Buddhist god called Fudo, or Achala [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q337624], who is my particular guardian, my personal guardian and my personal teacher, and, so I use, I refer to him, in several poems. The other two poems in which I refer to him actually are a piece called \"Smokey the Bear Sutra\", and another piece called \"Spell Against Demons\". This is the final, actually, this is the third and final poem in the trilogy of Fudo poems. Also. But you'll find all about Fudo in this poem, it'll drive you crazy.    \n \nGary Snyder\n00:19:48\nReads \"The California Water Plan\" [later published in The Fudo Trilogy].\n \nGary Snyder\n00:25:34\n\"Kumarajiva's Mother\". Now, the rest of these poems that I'm going to read this evening are cutting back and forth between ancient India [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q668] and ancient North America. I--living as I do and where I have lived all my life, we face the Pacific [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q98]. And, the American Indian came from Asia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q48], or vice versa, the Asians came from North America. I mean I know a Shoshone who says that. He says, \"We've always been here, those Asians came from here\". [Laughter].  \"What do you mean we came from someplace else, that's some white anthropologist theory\". [Laughter]. \"Kumarajiva's Mother.\" Kumarajiva [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q335293] was a great Buddhist monk-scholar-translator, who was kidnapped by the Chinese from Central Asia, by force, and carried off to China [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q148] where he was made to translate Sanskrit Buddhist texts into Chinese, and he stayed there the rest of his life, with a crew of about eighty Chinese assistants, day and night, translating sutras. He did a lot of translation. He also got in trouble, because he liked girls, and on one occasion, because he actually had mistresses apparently, he ate a bowl of needles, like you sew with needles, in front of an assembly of all the monks and assistants in Peking [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q956], or no it wasn't Peking in those days, it was Chang'an [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6501000], all of the monks and assistants in the capital, Chang'an, and then he said, \"When you boys can eat needles, you can have girlfriends too\". [Audience laughter]. But this poem is about his mother. [Audience laughter]. And I really, I mean I could explain to you why I wrote this poem but it isn't really worth explaining, I'll just read it. It has to do partly with the fact that my mother has freckles. And I was trying to figure out at this time, when I wrote this, I was trying to figure out whatever happened to women in Buddhism? Like something happened to 'em. They got lost. For a long time, anyway.\n \nGary Snyder\n00:28:22\nReads \"Kumarajiva's Mother\".\n \nEND\n00:30:59\n",

He brought the school of Buddhism, which is called the school of Mind Only, and the school of Emptiness. That's one aspect of this next poem. Another aspect is a little petroglyph, American Indian petroglyph figure, called the hump-backed flute player, a little stick figure playing the flute, with a pack on his back, walking. He was found pecked on the rocks from Sonora [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q46422], Mexico [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q96] up into the Great Basin, and about which almost nothing is known. The Ghost Dance, which was a Messianic Indian religion, started by a Paiute named Wovoka https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q558420], which asserted that perhaps by magic the white man could be swept away from North America and the game would return.  And finally, the oldest living beings are the bristle-coned pine, who live in the White Mountains [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1556007], at an elevation of nine thousand feet in eastern California, the oldest of which is something like four thousand five hundred years old. So this poem is called \"The Humpbacked Flute Player\".\n \nGary Snyder\n00:01:59\nReads \"The Humpbacked Flute Player\" from Coyote\u2019s Journal #9 [and published later in Mountains and Rivers Without End]. \n \nGary Snyder\n00:08:36\nI'm going to finish with one more poem called \"Down\". These poems are not in the order that they're going to be, but they're in a convenient order for the moment.\n \nGary Snyder\n00:09:05\nReads \"Down\".\n \nAudience\n00:11:48\nApplause.\n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:12:18\nI can't thank you for that. I don't know any way. Charles Simic [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q722555] will be reading on November 19th. Thank you. \n\nAudience\n00:12:40 \nApplause.\n\nEND\n00:12:45\n",

Some of the phonemes on the ends of words are prolonged, and others are stuttered. I'm not sure that any of them that are stuttered are in this particular batch. I wrote about 500 of these in late 1961, early--late, let's see, late \u201860 and early \u201861.

This is from the, an article in the Scientific American [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q39379]...\n\nUnknown\n00:48:05\n[Cut or edit made in tape.

I did a concert of my works along with Jim Tenney [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q715379] and Max Neuhaus [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2182711], in town hall, New York in September of 1966, and still earlier Max Neuhaus had realized this particular piece which is a piece produced by subjecting the electric typewriter keyboard to randomization by random numbers, so it looks like a lot of different characters from the electric typewriter, Neuhaus recorded it at the University of Illinois [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1145814] laboratory, I guess some time earlier in \u201866 or maybe \u201865 and then put it down four octaves. He and another guy were reading from--the readers read from this in any way they wish, now I'll have the live readers to come up here...So then in... in this \u201866 concert, I did it as a duet, reading through the negatives from which this was printed, the blinking light, and a Jeanne Lee [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q274580], a very fine blues singer was in the various works that were performed in that concert, and she's on the duet that you hear, that you will hear. A year ago, or a little more, I guess in April of last year I performed this in a class at NYU [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q49210] along with the-oh and the Neuhaus tape was along with that performance in NYU, then the town hall performance and the Neuhaus tape--all three were in the NYU performance along with the NYU performance, so now you'll hear it at least four different times, plus the present, something like that.\n \nJackson Mac Low\n00:58:23\nPerforms unnamed piece accompanied by recording. \n \nJackson Mac Low\n01:06:11\nI'll do a piece called \"Fifth Gatha'', which is another group piece, uh, the readers who learned it, please come up with copies, and I'll have to toss around tapes for a few minutes here. I might explain that this particular piece is one of a series I call \"Gathas\" that are written on graphed paper, they by chance operations. I take the mantra of one religion or another, this happens to be the great prajnaparamita mantra, which is basic to Northern Buddhism and Zen Buddhism, and it's arranged by the method so that it falls over an axis of 'a's, 'u's and 'm's that is the word 'aum', wherever a's, u's and m's appear in the mantra they may cross the mantra, there aren't many u's in this particular one, so there isn't any--nothing crossing the u-line, you may be able to see the empty gap there. The mantra in question is \"Gone, gone to the other shore, quite gone over the other shore, boldly, wisdom, spaha, pray. Guthe, guthe, paraguthe [unintelligible]...\" you may, those of you who know zen may be more familiar with it in its Japanese version, which is sort of a Japanization of the Sanskrit. The group version of it was done in the Chelsea Hotel [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q240711], I think in '67, but the German editor and producer, Carl Weissner [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1040995], the whisper version you hear, I did at home, earlier, maybe in \u201866, \u201865, \u201866. \n \nJackson Mac Low\n01:09:35\nPerforms \"Fifth Gatha\" accompanied by audience members and recording.\n \nJackson Mac Low\n01:26:20\nThe last poem I read was also from Stanzas for Iris Lezak. It's based on the Tibetan prayer to the gurus and it's translated by W.Y. Evans-Wentz [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q456451]. The next piece is all about bluebirds. It\u2019s again--it uses the form of...In recent years I've gone back to writing poems in the form of the asymmetries that I wrote in \u201860 and \u201861, but these tended to cluster around one subject matter. There's one in the current Aspen Magazine [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4807826] about young turtles, no one really knows where they go once they've hatched, and they know when they come back, but they don't really know what they do in between hatching and there is a natural history magazine, there was a caption to a picture, and so there was a record in the current Aspen, that's of that group. This is the first one of this type that I did on bluebirds, was for a group event that a number of us, let\u2019s see, Iris Lezak, Emmett Williams [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q719185], Carol [Bouget (?)] and [Jet Yalka (?)] and I did a collective event for the University of Syracuse [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q617433] at Utica [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2495519], which we called, which Emmett named for us [\"Jack-a-Jurismatics (?)\u201d] and so one of the pieces I wrote for that was this bluebirds piece. Emmett Williams has a beautiful work that has bluebirds in it, it's a permutation poem that also appears in this anthology, although this is an anthology that La Monte Young [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q432822] got together in \u201860 and we--\u201860 and \u201861 I guess, and he had many difficulties between the time that it was designed and the time it was printed and finally got it out at first in 1963, it's called An Anthology of--well, various things--Chance Operations, and well I don't know what, concept art, anti-art, indeterminacy improvisation, meaningless work, natural disasters and so on. And well, just recently, our first edition is now a sort of a collector's item, sells around a hundred, but recently a German publisher re-published it for us and the current, the new editions is going for $8.50, so if anyone is--I don't have copies here but I'll be happy to send any to anybody. Contains work mostly, a lot of it is music, musical scores, there's some other poetry, including the Emmett Williams mention. The Emmett Williams poem does all the variations, does all the permutations of one group of things, \"somewhere bluebirds are flying high in the sky, in the cellar even blackbirds are extinct\", each of those is considered a run unit, and all the possible permutations of them are written out \"somewhere bluebirds are flying high in the sky, in the cellar even blackbirds are extinct\". I'd love to read it, but it's very long. Usually we read it with five different voices, each taking the unit and once in a while, people get through it without breaking down laughing. [Unintelligible]. This was taken from, the bluebird asymmetries were from two...were from two encyclopedia articles on bluebirds, one I think the Audubon Encyclopedia, and I've forgotten what the other one was. They're very complimentary. The voices you hear are, you heard in another performance of Leslie [Sixfin (?)], Amy [Spurling (?)] and Harvey [Lesain (?)], along with four of my students at the Mannes School of Music [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1519151] and about done in 1966, or 1967, I think it was May of 1967 that this was done. There's a specially gifted group I felt that I happened to get together in that class, just towards the end we were doing mostly, we were just doing ordinary grammar English, I'm an English teacher, for my bread.\n \nEND\n01:32:11\n\n\njackson_maclow_i006-11-031-2.mp3 [File 2 of  2]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n00:00:00\nThis is the one you wanted some light percussive stuff?\n\nJackson Mac Low\n00:00:04\nYeah, but very easy on it, not very, you know, keep the amplitude down to, no higher than mezzo piano.

Unfortunately, my machine was bombed out, the corporation seems to be on the rocks, they're not providing the machine, but luckily I had poems that appeared on cathode ray tubes or something called a programmable film reader, and the words appear at the same time we sent the same impulses through an audio system and they turned out to be, well the oboe family, everything down from sopranino oboe to double, double, double bass oboe according to how long the lines were and so I did quite a few poems, this particular one is \"The\", and it's the last one I did, and tried to grab I guess three pages each, just use whatever discretion you want to, and listen, listen, listen. Earlier I had very strict rules governed by chance operations and so on, in reading these, well, in reading these kind of simultaneous works, and more and more I came to the, well I always had the principal of the most important things was to listen hard to everything that was happening, including whatever was happening in the room, whatever\u2019s happening outside and so on, but more and more I relied on the readers to judge when to come in, and in--perform--these I found, this is one very long print-out of this particular poem. I don't want to--I think in, I don't remember, someplace there's a description of the idea of how they were made and all that, but what I got was a number of messages that, of which the units were permuted, the earliest form of my program was simply permuting the words in each, single words in each message. Later on I was able to get carriage returns and things like that so that in this, each message is a group of short sentences, usually about the same thing, and you'll, so that on the page each message looks like a sort of a stanza or strophe, and the groups of sentences--any number of the groups of sentences from any one of these strophe units may appear at any time according to way the thing is programmed. Does everybody have about three pages?

Unfortunately, my machine was bombed out, the corporation seems to be on the rocks, they're not providing the machine, but luckily I had poems that appeared on cathode ray tubes or something called a programmable film reader, and the words appear at the same time we sent the same impulses through an audio system and they turned out to be, well the oboe family, everything down from sopranino oboe to double, double, double bass oboe according to how long the lines were and so I did quite a few poems, this particular one is \"The\", and it's the last one I did, and tried to grab I guess three pages each, just use whatever discretion you want to, and listen, listen, listen. Earlier I had very strict rules governed by chance operations and so on, in reading these, well, in reading these kind of simultaneous works, and more and more I came to the, well I always had the principal of the most important things was to listen hard to everything that was happening, including whatever was happening in the room, whatever\u2019s happening outside and so on, but more and more I relied on the readers to judge when to come in, and in--perform--these I found, this is one very long print-out of this particular poem. I don't want to--I think in, I don't remember, someplace there's a description of the idea of how they were made and all that, but what I got was a number of messages that, of which the units were permuted, the earliest form of my program was simply permuting the words in each, single words in each message. Later on I was able to get carriage returns and things like that so that in this, each message is a group of short sentences, usually about the same thing, and you'll, so that on the page each message looks like a sort of a stanza or strophe, and the groups of sentences--any number of the groups of sentences from any one of these strophe units may appear at any time according to way the thing is programmed.

I did a concert of my works along with Jim Tenney [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q715379] and Max Neuhaus [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2182711], in town hall, New York in September of 1966, and still earlier Max Neuhaus had realized this particular piece which is a piece produced by subjecting the electric typewriter keyboard to randomization by random numbers, so it looks like a lot of different characters from the electric typewriter, Neuhaus recorded it at the University of Illinois [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1145814] laboratory, I guess some time earlier in \u201866 or maybe \u201865 and then put it down four octaves. He and another guy were reading from--the readers read from this in any way they wish, now I'll have the live readers to come up here...So then in... in this \u201866 concert, I did it as a duet, reading through the negatives from which this was printed, the blinking light, and a Jeanne Lee [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q274580], a very fine blues singer was in the various works that were performed in that concert, and she's on the duet that you hear, that you will hear. A year ago, or a little more, I guess in April of last year I performed this in a class at NYU [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q49210] along with the-oh and the Neuhaus tape was along with that performance in NYU, then the town hall performance and the Neuhaus tape--all three were in the NYU performance along with the NYU performance, so now you'll hear it at least four different times, plus the present, something like that.\n \nJackson Mac Low\n00:58:23\nPerforms unnamed piece accompanied by recording. \n \nJackson Mac Low\n01:06:11\nI'll do a piece called \"Fifth Gatha'', which is another group piece, uh, the readers who learned it, please come up with copies, and I'll have to toss around tapes for a few minutes here. I might explain that this particular piece is one of a series I call \"Gathas\" that are written on graphed paper, they by chance operations. I take the mantra of one religion or another, this happens to be the great prajnaparamita mantra, which is basic to Northern Buddhism and Zen Buddhism, and it's arranged by the method so that it falls over an axis of 'a's, 'u's and 'm's that is the word 'aum', wherever a's, u's and m's appear in the mantra they may cross the mantra, there aren't many u's in this particular one, so there isn't any--nothing crossing the u-line, you may be able to see the empty gap there. The mantra in question is \"Gone, gone to the other shore, quite gone over the other shore, boldly, wisdom, spaha, pray. Guthe, guthe, paraguthe [unintelligible]...\" you may, those of you who know zen may be more familiar with it in its Japanese version, which is sort of a Japanization of the Sanskrit. The group version of it was done in the Chelsea Hotel [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q240711], I think in '67, but the German editor and producer, Carl Weissner [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1040995], the whisper version you hear, I did at home, earlier, maybe in \u201866, \u201865, \u201866. \n \nJackson Mac Low\n01:09:35\nPerforms \"Fifth Gatha\" accompanied by audience members and recording.\n \nJackson Mac Low\n01:26:20\nThe last poem I read was also from Stanzas for Iris Lezak. It's based on the Tibetan prayer to the gurus and it's translated by W.Y. Evans-Wentz [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q456451]. The next piece is all about bluebirds. It\u2019s again--it uses the form of...In recent years I've gone back to writing poems in the form of the asymmetries that I wrote in \u201860 and \u201861, but these tended to cluster around one subject matter. There's one in the current Aspen Magazine [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4807826] about young turtles, no one really knows where they go once they've hatched, and they know when they come back, but they don't really know what they do in between hatching and there is a natural history magazine, there was a caption to a picture, and so there was a record in the current Aspen, that's of that group. This is the first one of this type that I did on bluebirds, was for a group event that a number of us, let\u2019s see, Iris Lezak, Emmett Williams [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q719185], Carol [Bouget (?)] and [Jet Yalka (?)] and I did a collective event for the University of Syracuse [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q617433] at Utica [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2495519], which we called, which Emmett named for us [\"Jack-a-Jurismatics (?)\u201d] and so one of the pieces I wrote for that was this bluebirds piece. Emmett Williams has a beautiful work that has bluebirds in it, it's a permutation poem that also appears in this anthology, although this is an anthology that La Monte Young [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q432822] got together in \u201860 and we--\u201860 and \u201861 I guess, and he had many difficulties between the time that it was designed and the time it was printed and finally got it out at first in 1963, it's called An Anthology of--well, various things--Chance Operations, and well I don't know what, concept art, anti-art, indeterminacy improvisation, meaningless work, natural disasters and so on. And well, just recently, our first edition is now a sort of a collector's item, sells around a hundred, but recently a German publisher re-published it for us and the current, the new editions is going for $8.50, so if anyone is--I don't have copies here but I'll be happy to send any to anybody. Contains work mostly, a lot of it is music, musical scores, there's some other poetry, including the Emmett Williams mention. The Emmett Williams poem does all the variations, does all the permutations of one group of things, \"somewhere bluebirds are flying high in the sky, in the cellar even blackbirds are extinct\", each of those is considered a run unit, and all the possible permutations of them are written out \"somewhere bluebirds are flying high in the sky, in the cellar even blackbirds are extinct\". I'd love to read it, but it's very long. Usually we read it with five different voices, each taking the unit and once in a while, people get through it without breaking down laughing. [Unintelligible]. This was taken from, the bluebird asymmetries were from two...were from two encyclopedia articles on bluebirds, one I think the Audubon Encyclopedia, and I've forgotten what the other one was. They're very complimentary. The voices you hear are, you heard in another performance of Leslie [Sixfin (?)], Amy [Spurling (?)] and Harvey [Lesain (?)], along with four of my students at the Mannes School of Music [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1519151] and about done in 1966, or 1967, I think it was May of 1967 that this was done. There's a specially gifted group I felt that I happened to get together in that class, just towards the end we were doing mostly, we were just doing ordinary grammar English, I'm an English teacher, for my bread.\n \nEND\n01:32:11\n",

Quote: \u201cAs far back as I can remember there was a kind of dumbness within me, a need that sought expression. How it eventually materialized in the act of writing a poem belongs to a biography which I have only been able to recount in a few successful poems. As for the finished product, the poem, my need requires it to be of, as Whitman [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q81438] said, the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands, and further, if they are not yours as much as mine, they are nothing, or next to nothing. On a subjective level, I write to give being to that vibration which is my life, and to survive in a hard time\u201d. Charles Simic [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q722555].\n \nCharles Simic\n00:00:57\nThank you. Is this mic also for the audience or just for the tape? Oh it is, okay. I'll be reading mostly from my third book, including also some more recent poems. And I'll start off with a very recent poem which is called \"Breasts\".\n \nCharles Simic\n00:02:07\nReads \"Breasts\" from Dismantling the Silence.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:05:05\nThis is not from the book. A series of poems really dealing with inanimate objects. And the first poem in the series is called \"Table\".\n \nCharles Simic\n00:05:27\nReads \"Table\" from Dismantling the Silence.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:06:55\nReads \"Stone\" from Dismantling the Silence.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:08:14\nThere's a poem about a fork, and also a poem about a spoon and knife, and I'll read \"The Fork\".\n \nCharles Simic\n00:08:26\nReads \"The Fork\" Dismantling the Silence.\n\nCharles Simic\n00:09:12\nReads \"My Shoes\" from Dismantling the Silence.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:10:42\nThe last one of these has not been included in the book. I only discovered it about a year ago, in a notebook, but it was written around the same time, and I've sort of been fooling around with it. It's called \"Brooms\".  There's five parts. I'll just make a little pause within each part.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:11:13\nReads \"Brooms\", Part I [published later in Return to a place lit by a glass of milk].\n \nCharles Simic\n00:11:43\nReads \"Brooms\", Part II [published later in Return to a place lit by a glass of milk].\n \nCharles Simic\n00:12:41\nReads \"Brooms\", Part III [published later in Return to a place lit by a glass of milk].\n \nCharles Simic\n00:13:24\nReads \"Brooms\", Part IV [published later in Return to a place lit by a glass of milk].\n \nCharles Simic\n00:14:06\nReads \"Brooms\", Part V [published later in Return to a place lit by a glass of milk].\n \nCharles Simic\n00:14:55\nI'll read you the last poem of, in the book of this particular series, which really has nothing to do with objects, but it's a poem in which I imagine what would happen if someone really penetrated one of these inanimate objects, like his pores, kind of a Christopher Columbus [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7322] of entering an ashtray or something. It's called \"Explorers\".\n \nCharles Simic\n00:15:33\nReads \"Explorers\" from Dismantling the Silence.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:17:13\nLet's see. This is, this is called \"The Inner Man\".\n \nCharles Simic\n00:17:40\nReads \"The Inner Man\" from  Dismantling the Silence.\n\nCharles Simic\n00:19:06\nThis poem, this next poem is called \"The Animals\". I wrote it in New York City [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60], after living in New York City for about five-six years, and lamenting the pastoral quality of my first book, and my inability to return to that kind of nature poetry. I realized that I hadn't seen a tree or an animal in about three or four years, and yet at the same time writing, you know, occasionally about some cows, or, you know, and I was saying, what are these animals, you know, these shadowy animals. Anyway, here's the poem. \"The Animals\".\n \nCharles Simic\n00:19:46\nReads \"The Animals\" from Dismantling the Silence.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:21:07\nLet's see. Sort of change to some different kinds of poems. Here's a poem about Chicago [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1297]. Going back to Chicago. And, to see my mother. And...it's all there anyway. Hopefully. There's seven parts.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:22:03\nReads \"Chicago\", Part I.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:22:43\nReads \"Chicago\", Part II.\n\nCharles Simic\n00:23:17\nReads \"Chicago\", Part III.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:23:57\nReads \"Chicago\", Part IV.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:24:35\nReads \"Chicago\", Part V.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:25:06\nReads \"Chicago\", Part VI.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:25:33\nReads \"Chicago\", Part VII.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:26:39\nLet's see. I can't find it. Maybe it's not written yet. Oh here it is, yeah. \n \nCharles Simic\n00:27:01\nReads \"Tapestry\" from Dismantling the Silence.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:28:15\nThis is a very different kind of poem. The material for the the poem is, are, cliches, working with, with awful cliches, things which were totally beaten to death and, you know, can't be used anymore. Or proverbs, popular wisdom, and I'm twisting it all around, trying to reverse the kind of universe that is implied by, by let's say proverbs, if you get up in the morning and such and such a thing happens. There is something very deterministic about it, and to reverse that, to give it a little fresh air, I'll turn it around. And so I have a sequence of six poems which are entirely made up of these things, and they're called, the common title is \"Concerning my Neighbors, the Hittites\", and the...why the Hittites [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5406]...why not? [Laughter]. Hittites were simply something that I had not the slightest idea about and I sort of saw ourselves one day becoming the Hittites, you know, somebody sitting one day in some future century and, our century being, sort of the Hittites, you know. And so there are six poems, and, I guess that's about all to be said.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:29:58\nReads \"Concerning My Neighbors, the Hittites\", Part I [published later in Selected Early Poems].\n \nCharles Simic\n00:31:21\nReads \"Concerning My Neighbors, the Hittites\", Part II [published later in Selected Early Poems].\n \nUnknown\n00:32:09\nSilence [pause].\n \nCharles Simic\n00:33:20\nReads \"Concerning My Neighbors, the Hittites\", Part III [published later in Selected Early Poems].\n \nCharles Simic\n00:34:20\nReads \"Concerning My Neighbors, the Hittites\", Part IV [ [published later in Selected Early Poems; includes extra stanzas not included in the published version of the poem].\n \nCharles Simic\n00:35:12\nReads \"Concerning My Neighbors, the Hittites\", Part V [published later in Selected Early Poems].\n \nCharles Simic\n00:36:14\nReads \"Concerning My Neighbors, the Hittites\", Part VI [published later in Selected Early Poems].\n\nCharles Simic\n00:36:23\nDo you, we need a break? Should we take a break? Huh? No, yes. No. Take a break. Yeah, let's take a ten-minute break.  \n\nAudience\n00:36:30\nApplause [cut off].\n \nEND\n00:36:39\n\n\ncharles_simic_i006-11-115-2.mp3 [File 2 of 2]\n\nCharles Simic\n00:00:00\nI was asking [Ksemi Rothers (?)] about, you know, who are my great grand-uncles, and great-grandfathers and so on, and I found out that they all were killed or disappeared in some completely forgotten nineteenth-century Balkan wars which no one knows anymore the cause or the reason or why they were started. And so this poem kind of happened out of that. It's called \"Marching\". \n \nCharles Simic \n00:00:47\nReads \"Marching\" from Dismantling the Silence.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:03:28\nThis is a kind of a, you could say that it's sort of an elegy for my father, in seven parts.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:03:47\nReads \u201cGeorge Simic\u201d [published later in Return to a place lit by a glass of milk].\n \nCharles Simic\n00:07:44\nThis is a love poem. I have a series of love poems in the new book but this is one of them. And I might use the title of this poem as the title of the new book. The title is \"Return to a place lit by a glass of milk\".\n \nCharles Simic\n00:08:08\nReads \"Return to a place lit by a glass of milk\" [published later in Return to a place lit by a glass of milk].\n \nCharles Simic\n00:09:20\nI want to read a couple more poems now. \"Dismantling the Silence\".\n \nCharles Simicn\n00:09:54\nReads \"Dismantling the Silence\" from Dismantling the Silence.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:11:17\nThe last poem in this book is called \"Errata\" for the good reason that after I finished the book I felt again, you know, a sense of frustration. I didn't say everything. And so each of the lines in this particular poem are really, refer to actual lines in the book. I'm kind of correcting myself. \"Errata\".\n \nCharles Simic\n00:11:53\nReads \"Errata\" from Dismantling the Silence.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:13:20\nThank you.  \n\nAudience\n00:13:23\nApplause.\n \nIntroducer\n00:13:35\nThe next reading will be on January 14th. Dorothy Livesay [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1250325] will read that night.\n \nEND\n00:13:44\n"

                "notes": "Poet, essayist and teacher Charles Simic was born in Belgrade, Yugoslavia on May 9, 1938 to Serbian parents. During his childhood, Simic witnessed both the military occupation by the Nazis during the Second World War, and then by the Soviet Union. His family left Yugoslavia for Paris in 1953, and then to Chicago in 1954. His first poem was published in the Chicago Review in 1959 when Simic was 19 years old. In 1961, Simic was enlisted in the US Army, and served until 1963 when he moved to New York City and enrolled in New York University. Simic met his future wife, designer Helene Dubin, with whom he had two children. Upon graduation with a B.A. in Russian in 1966, he worked as an editorial assistant for Aperture, a photography magazine. Simic\u2019s first collection of poems, What the Grass Says (Kayak) was published in 1967 and was followed in 1969 with Somewhere Among Us a Stone Is Taking Notes (Kayak), and a number of anthologies, including Young American Poets (Follett Publishing Co, 1968), Contemporary American Poets (World Publishing Company, 1969), and Major Young American Poets (World Publishing Co, 1971). In 1970, Simic began teaching English at the University of California at Hayward, and earned a PEN International Award for his translation of Fire Gardens (New Rivers Press), written by Ivan V. Lalic. At that time, Simic also published an anthology of translations Four Modern Yugoslav Poets: Ivan V. Lalic, Branko Miljkovic, Milorad Pavic, Ljubomir Simovic, translations of Vasko Popa\u2019s The Little Box (Charioteer Press, 1970) and his own collection of poetry, Dismantling the Silence (G. Braziller, 1971). Simic then received a fellowship from the Guggenheim Foundation, published White (New Rivers Press, 1972) and took a position of associate professor at the University of New Hampshire in 1973, which he would hold for over thirty years. A wildly prolific writer, Simic published poetry, translations and non-fiction, including Charon\u2019s Cosmology (G. Braziller, 1977) which won the National Book Award, School for Dark Thoughts (Banyan Press, 1978), Classic Ballroom Dances (G. Braziller, 1980) which won both the Harriet Monroe Poetry Award and the Di Castagnola Award, Austerities (G. Braziller, 1982), Weather Forecast for Utopia and Vicinity (Station Hill Press, 1983), Unending Blues (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1986), Brooms: Selected Poems (Edge, 1978), Selected Poems 1963-1983 (G. Braziller, 1985), The World Doesn\u2019t End (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1989) which won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1990, The Book of Gods and Devils (Harcourt Brace, 1990) and Hotel Insomnia (Harcourt, 1992). The 1990s saw Simic publishing numerous translations from Yugoslavian poets. Collections of Simic\u2019s essays and memoirs include The Unemployed Fortune-Teller (Michigan Press, 1994), Orphan Factory (University of Michigan, 1997), Walking the Black Cat (Harcourt Brace & Co, 1996) and his more recent poetry collection The Voice at 3:00 am: Selected Late and New Poems (A.W. Ellsworth, 2003). In 2007, Simic was appointed U.S. Poet Laureate. Simic resides in Strafford, New Hampshire."

                "contents": "charles_simic_i006-11-115-1.mp3 [File 1 of 2]\n\nIntroducer\n00:00:05\nA short quotation which appears in the Contributors' Notes to Paul Carroll's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q15459057] anthology The Young American Poets. Quote: \u201cAs far back as I can remember there was a kind of dumbness within me, a need that sought expression. How it eventually materialized in the act of writing a poem belongs to a biography which I have only been able to recount in a few successful poems. As for the finished product, the poem, my need requires it to be of, as Whitman [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q81438] said, the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands, and further, if they are not yours as much as mine, they are nothing, or next to nothing. On a subjective level, I write to give being to that vibration which is my life, and to survive in a hard time\u201d. Charles Simic [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q722555].\n \nCharles Simic\n00:00:57\nThank you. Is this mic also for the audience or just for the tape? Oh it is, okay. I'll be reading mostly from my third book, including also some more recent poems. And I'll start off with a very recent poem which is called \"Breasts\".\n \nCharles Simic\n00:02:07\nReads \"Breasts\" from Dismantling the Silence.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:05:05\nThis is not from the book. A series of poems really dealing with inanimate objects. And the first poem in the series is called \"Table\".\n \nCharles Simic\n00:05:27\nReads \"Table\" from Dismantling the Silence.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:06:55\nReads \"Stone\" from Dismantling the Silence.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:08:14\nThere's a poem about a fork, and also a poem about a spoon and knife, and I'll read \"The Fork\".\n \nCharles Simic\n00:08:26\nReads \"The Fork\" Dismantling the Silence.\n\nCharles Simic\n00:09:12\nReads \"My Shoes\" from Dismantling the Silence.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:10:42\nThe last one of these has not been included in the book. I only discovered it about a year ago, in a notebook, but it was written around the same time, and I've sort of been fooling around with it. It's called \"Brooms\".  There's five parts. I'll just make a little pause within each part.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:11:13\nReads \"Brooms\", Part I [published later in Return to a place lit by a glass of milk].\n \nCharles Simic\n00:11:43\nReads \"Brooms\", Part II [published later in Return to a place lit by a glass of milk].\n \nCharles Simic\n00:12:41\nReads \"Brooms\", Part III [published later in Return to a place lit by a glass of milk].\n \nCharles Simic\n00:13:24\nReads \"Brooms\", Part IV [published later in Return to a place lit by a glass of milk].\n \nCharles Simic\n00:14:06\nReads \"Brooms\", Part V [published later in Return to a place lit by a glass of milk].\n \nCharles Simic\n00:14:55\nI'll read you the last poem of, in the book of this particular series, which really has nothing to do with objects, but it's a poem in which I imagine what would happen if someone really penetrated one of these inanimate objects, like his pores, kind of a Christopher Columbus [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7322] of entering an ashtray or something. It's called \"Explorers\".\n \nCharles Simic\n00:15:33\nReads \"Explorers\" from Dismantling the Silence.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:17:13\nLet's see. This is, this is called \"The Inner Man\".\n \nCharles Simic\n00:17:40\nReads \"The Inner Man\" from  Dismantling the Silence.\n\nCharles Simic\n00:19:06\nThis poem, this next poem is called \"The Animals\". I wrote it in New York City [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60], after living in New York City for about five-six years, and lamenting the pastoral quality of my first book, and my inability to return to that kind of nature poetry. I realized that I hadn't seen a tree or an animal in about three or four years, and yet at the same time writing, you know, occasionally about some cows, or, you know, and I was saying, what are these animals, you know, these shadowy animals. Anyway, here's the poem. \"The Animals\".\n \nCharles Simic\n00:19:46\nReads \"The Animals\" from Dismantling the Silence.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:21:07\nLet's see. Sort of change to some different kinds of poems. Here's a poem about Chicago [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1297]. Going back to Chicago. And, to see my mother. And...it's all there anyway. Hopefully. There's seven parts.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:22:03\nReads \"Chicago\", Part I.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:22:43\nReads \"Chicago\", Part II.\n\nCharles Simic\n00:23:17\nReads \"Chicago\", Part III.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:23:57\nReads \"Chicago\", Part IV.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:24:35\nReads \"Chicago\", Part V.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:25:06\nReads \"Chicago\", Part VI.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:25:33\nReads \"Chicago\", Part VII.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:26:39\nLet's see. I can't find it. Maybe it's not written yet. Oh here it is, yeah. \n \nCharles Simic\n00:27:01\nReads \"Tapestry\" from Dismantling the Silence.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:28:15\nThis is a very different kind of poem. The material for the the poem is, are, cliches, working with, with awful cliches, things which were totally beaten to death and, you know, can't be used anymore. Or proverbs, popular wisdom, and I'm twisting it all around, trying to reverse the kind of universe that is implied by, by let's say proverbs, if you get up in the morning and such and such a thing happens. There is something very deterministic about it, and to reverse that, to give it a little fresh air, I'll turn it around. And so I have a sequence of six poems which are entirely made up of these things, and they're called, the common title is \"Concerning my Neighbors, the Hittites\", and the...why the Hittites [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5406]...why not? [Laughter]. Hittites were simply something that I had not the slightest idea about and I sort of saw ourselves one day becoming the Hittites, you know, somebody sitting one day in some future century and, our century being, sort of the Hittites, you know. And so there are six poems, and, I guess that's about all to be said.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:29:58\nReads \"Concerning My Neighbors, the Hittites\", Part I [published later in Selected Early Poems].\n \nCharles Simic\n00:31:21\nReads \"Concerning My Neighbors, the Hittites\", Part II [published later in Selected Early Poems].\n \nUnknown\n00:32:09\nSilence [pause].\n \nCharles Simic\n00:33:20\nReads \"Concerning My Neighbors, the Hittites\", Part III [published later in Selected Early Poems].\n \nCharles Simic\n00:34:20\nReads \"Concerning My Neighbors, the Hittites\", Part IV [ [published later in Selected Early Poems; includes extra stanzas not included in the published version of the poem].\n \nCharles Simic\n00:35:12\nReads \"Concerning My Neighbors, the Hittites\", Part V [published later in Selected Early Poems].\n \nCharles Simic\n00:36:14\nReads \"Concerning My Neighbors, the Hittites\", Part VI [published later in Selected Early Poems].\n\nCharles Simic\n00:36:23\nDo you, we need a break? Should we take a break? Huh? No, yes. No. Take a break. Yeah, let's take a ten-minute break.  \n\nAudience\n00:36:30\nApplause [cut off].\n \nEND\n00:36:39\n",

And so this poem kind of happened out of that. It's called \"Marching\". \n \nCharles Simic \n00:00:47\nReads \"Marching\" from Dismantling the Silence.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:03:28\nThis is a kind of a, you could say that it's sort of an elegy for my father, in seven parts.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:03:47\nReads \u201cGeorge Simic\u201d [published later in Return to a place lit by a glass of milk].\n \nCharles Simic\n00:07:44\nThis is a love poem.

I didn't say everything. And so each of the lines in this particular poem are really, refer to actual lines in the book. I'm kind of correcting myself. \"Errata\".\n \nCharles Simic\n00:11:53\nReads \"Errata\" from Dismantling the Silence.\n \nCharles Simic\n00:13:20\nThank you.  \n\nAudience\n00:13:23\nApplause.\n \nIntroducer\n00:13:35\nThe next reading will be on January 14th.

Their poetry is quite different, as you'll discover. But from my own point of view, they...I owe both of them a debt that is similar in both cases though neither probably knows it. They've made me, in their own ways, rethink my own feelings about  what ought to constitute poetry and poems. And in the case of Maxine Gadd, this thinking went into a review which was then sent to the Firepoint which then folded. So you may never see that. And in the case of Andy Schroeder [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4755619], found its way into a long tape harangue between the two of us on the subject of form in poetry. Which I think is now in the Sir George Williams Library [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5159005], where any of you can endure it if you wish to. At any rate, the first of these poets to read will be Maxine Gadd. There will be a fifteen minute break, and then Andreas Schroeder will read. Maxine. \n \nAudience\n00:01:32\nApplause. \n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:02:01\nYou're plugged in. \n \nMaxine Gadd\n00:02:03\nOh boy. Can you hear me? I don't know how much projection to do. I don't know how much to talk about the poetry. My connection is very loose to the mainstream I guess, because, I don't know, I'm just not socially related to what's going on maybe in the poetry reading. I guess my identifications with words are somewhat with a West Coast hippie trip. And between the country and the city, the first feeling being, you know, the desire for purity, you know when you're seventeen or eighteen years old and you've figured the country life is it. And later coming to realize the necessity of the communal life and the city. So I think that's a task I'm going to try to set myself right here. I...this...I'm going to read first of all the second \"well\" poem, which I did, experienced in the country, living in the country. I remember the first \"well\" poem, I don't remember where it's gone, because it didn't get published. I disregarded its importance, you know. I tended to take the judgment of editors, and you know, people that set themselves up as authorities, and that's why I'm here, you know. I've kept close enough to them, I guess. I remember the first one went something like, \"Wanting pure water I went to the well\/too wonderful\"...and there was something about the oracle as the bucket clacked. This is the \u201cSecond Well Poem\u201d. \n \nMaxine Gadd\n00:03:57\nReads \"Second Well Poem\" [published later as \u201cWell poem\u201d in Lost Language].\n\nMaxine Gadd\n00:04:41\nWhich is about where I feel right now. But that's about where my connection to poetry is right now. I wonder if that...I wonder if that one's around. I don't think it is. I guess I'll just take it as it comes. There's some scheme in this. I guess, I got published by a cat, by bill bissett [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4911496] you might have heard, who did the thing, did the guru thing, the super-energy thing of getting a lot of work done, and getting a lot of people's work out, and a lot of his work out, a lot of it was real shit but he got it out, you know, and some of it worked and some of it didn't, but there was so much of it, you know...I'd like to have had that confidence, you know, I guess almost, most people write poetry, they've got it all in their trunk, you know, they don't get it out. But I guess that's what it takes. This is from one of his first, really cheap magazines. He put, he...it's typed, you know. Pretty good typing. His typing got worse, I get very angry, he makes lots of mistakes. But he did a lot of drawings and things, if anybody wants to look at it, you know.  I mean, he did it minimum, you know, he was living really poor. And a lot of people still read his stuff, so, I mean, to me he was a folk poet in that sense, a lot of people still read his stuff because he got the stuff out cheap, you know. \"Trip\".\n \nMaxine Gadd\n00:06:05\nReads \"Trip\".\n \nMaxine Gadd\n00:07:47\nI'm going to go over there. This one is to a poet who is in the, is in another world, okay? He looks like a silver lizard, and he's very beautiful, and he knows all about the Greek trip, and Eleusis, which is one's talking about in the first poem, okay, the oracles from under the ground, that belief you must start out with.

Oh, I should have explained that before, yeah. Oh yeah, this is where I met...now I don't like it okay? And it's probably not a good poem. But that's, that's...you know, that's...the kind of art form I'd like to have seen as a collective art form, was what I yearned and hoped for. Poetry is what people write in rooms alone, and I don't like...I don't, you know, that's what I was stuck with. And I worked for a while with a group in Vancouver called, named, we called it \"Intermedia\". And I had the experience of working with a group, at one point there were five of us poets, you know, or what we called poets. And we'd go around to various places, we went to Edmonton [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2096] one time, and we tried things, we tried chanting and wailing, like, was it...who was that crazy old lady. Sitwell, Edith Sitwell [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q259921], remember her? And if you ever heard the sort of sing, the song, sing sing she used to do, you know, we tried that. And it really worked, you know, but you'd go around and you'd say, \"Do you dig the poems?\" and they'd say, \"I can't hear them, but we really like your voice.\" You know. [Audience laughter]. So, you know, left that, you got an ache in the gut or something.   \n \nMaxine Gadd\n00:11:37\nReads \"Ratio\".\n \nMaxine Gadd\n00:12:48\nI don't like it. I don't want to be there. Here's one from last year. I got into printing stuff myself, you know, and I do that--I wish, oh, you can't see it, can you? It was mimeograph, it was real cheap, you know? And you could take images, you could take newspaper articles, you could take scraps of anything you saw that you dug, you know, put 'em together, and to me that was a, that was a form of concrete poetry. Can't, of course, I don't know, you couldn't really say that one or any number of them. This one is half-said, okay. Behind it I put a map, I found a map of B.C. [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1974]and Minster Island [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q21906024] was a map, was an island I found once when I was working on a ship as a mess girl, on a freighter. \n \nMaxine Gadd\n00:13:46\nReads unnamed poem.\n \nMaxine Gadd\n00:15:33\nAnd where that ended up was just over the name Bella Coola [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q815765], which is sort of where they do, can fish. There's no escape, though, you know? And...so then I want to read about Kitsilano [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4179275], where most of...I happened, you know, I grew up. Kitsilano's a sort of slum district of Vancouver. And it's disintegrating, and you probably all experienced this, you know, being city people, you know, they're bulldozing the places, there's no more cheap places to live, and so your friends, you know, you can't live there anymore, your friends can't live there anymore, so whatever you had, which was sometimes very heavy, you know, community's really beautiful, you know? I used to go over and play music with my friends. We had to move out, you know, because the city's being destroyed, and only the people who are well-to-do, who have some sort of stake in the city, you know, who are supporting the structure can stay. And this poem is about somebody who I met one day on the street, you know, and her story, she's sort of sick, just on the street, everything's falling to pieces. \n \nMaxine Gadd\n00:16:55\nReads \u201cbee-people on 4th avenue\u201d [published later in Lost Language].\n\nMaxine Gadd\n00:18:32\nWho's singing out there? But here, on the next street, you know, I ran into a friend of mine. Her name's Martina. And, you know, we're about the same age, and we've been through a lot of things, and, we've been through some bad things, you know, lots of rejections and refusal, no, there's no food now, you can't have any, go away, you know, fighting over somebody or other. \n \nMaxine Gadd\n00:18:58\nReads \u201c4th ave\u201d [published later in Lost Language].\n \nMaxine Gadd\n00:20:49\nUs old ladies.

It'll be up to Andy. I'd like to introduce to you Andy Schroeder.\n \nAudience\n00:00:15\nApplause.\n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:00:40\nRight. Normally they hang you after a reading. Jesus. I'm going to read from, oh, just kind of a merry jaunt through various books. I think what I'll do is I'll read some of the, some poetry first, and then I'll slip over into fiction. I've just, two days ago, published a book called The Late Man of short fictions and extended prose poems and so on. The work that I've done is gone cyclic in terms of form. I started out with prose poems and went into much more of a linear poetry, and then went back to a fiction which was kind of a half prose poem, half short story, half God knows, film script. And right now I'm working hard at both styles. First book I published was called The Ozone Minotaur, and it was more surreal than anything I'm doing now. I really get very excited about illusions, and I guess that's probably what most of my work is all about. At first I was very interested in surreal illusions; now I'm very interested in real illusions, and I'm not sure there's any difference. Here's a prose poem from way back called \"Introduction\".\n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:02:10\nReads \"Introduction\" from The Ozone Minotaur.\n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:03:15\nAfter I found out that you couldn't live by writing poetry, I took a job with CPAir [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q986941]. That doesn't really sound like a very logical progression, but anyway, it was a teletype machine that they put me on, I think I lasted about four days, but I got a poem out of it, and it's entitled \"Cables\".\n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:03:35\nReads \"Cables\" [from The Ozone Minotaur].\n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:05:29\nThis next book, File of Uncertainties, I supposed was kind of created when I woke up one morning and was overwhelmed with my own ignorance, so I decided to write a book about it. [Audience laughter]. And then I figured the best way to do it was to go up north and I did that, and I spent a winter up in Alaska [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q797]. And that was where I really got into this illusion thing, because, you know, all the different, very very strange things that happen there, like white-outs, which you probably are familiar with here, as well, where a man suddenly loses all sense of up and down and forward and backward. They have better ones than that, though. They have, until the snowmobile rolls around, when people used to mush with dogs, they'd continually have this happening: a man would set off from one village for another, with his dogs, and he'd be perfectly well-dressed and perfectly well-fed, and apparently perfectly sane, and the dogs would arrive, and the sled would arrive but the man wouldn't, and they possibly found him and possibly not. But no one could ever understand what would make a man suddenly step off his sleigh and walk off in an entirely different direction to die. When he certainly didn't have it on his list of things to do when he left. They still haven't figured that out. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that man's body is made up of such an incredible percentage of water, and very strange things happen to water up there. [Audience laughter]. Anyway, I almost got caught by an avalanche, so I thought I'd check into it and I'd find out what you do if you do get caught by one, cause I figured by that time that survival was probably a good thing. So, they said, one of the things you do is, if you get caught by an avalanche, you make swimming motions with your hands. I guess the idea is that kind of tends to keep you close to the surface, which is a good place to be. Now...[audience laughter] the lovely illusion part, which really intrigued me, was that a man can survive under the snow up to a depth of approximately six feet, but only for a certain period of time, and apparently the closer you are to the surface, the better your chances are, and the way they dig for, well, it's not necessarily logical up there, at least it didn't seem like it, but the way they dig for a man like this is they use sounding rods, and these are very sensitive rods, like, almost like tuning forks, and they walk along, in a very definite rhythm, it's almost like a musical score, and they ram these poles in, one foot deep, about a foot at a time, and attempt to hit somebody that's buried underneath it. And then they go back again and they do it at two feet, and then at three feet and four feet to six feet, they don't go any deeper. Now the peculiar part of it is that they of course can't hear anyone, but the poor bugger that's under the snow can hear very, very clearly. And, you know, and he'll hear people saying, like I wonder where, I think there's a place he might be, and he'll be shouting in there, saying, \"I'm here,\" you know, \"I'm here!\" and they can't hear him, and it's really quite terrifying. Sound only travels one way through an avalanche, I don't...[Audience laughter]. Anyway, I'll, let me read some poems about it, I'll...File of Uncertainties was written in a very short time and mostly about the same thing, and you'll find recurring images all the way through, stylistic things that are similar all the way through, and the poems, because they match together fairly tightly, I didn't even bother naming them, I just numbered them, because they're all part of the same sequence. This is number four. \n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:09:27\nReads \"File of Uncertainties: #4\" from File of Uncertainties.\n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:10:25\nReads \"File of Uncertainties: #3\" from File of Uncertainties.\n\nAndreas Schroeder\n00:12:13\nReads \"File of Uncertainties: #5\" from File of Uncertainties.\n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:12:54\nReads \"File of Uncertainties: #8\" from File of Uncertainties.\n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:13:50\nI took up sky-diving after I came back and, because...yeah, believe it or not, it had very similar illusions going for it again. When...it's much like the white-out. When you jump off an aircraft, and it banks away, generally to your left, then you suddenly lose all points of reference. And because the earth below you is much too far away to really mean anything, and your parachute is still on your back, in other words not opened, so you can't, you haven't got anything above you either, you suddenly get hit with this incredibly stony silence, and absolutely nothing happens. I mean, you don't fall, you're not moving, you're not even really thinking because it's so suddenly quiet. It seems like everything just freezes. And in fact you're falling at about three hundred feet a second, but you have no sense of it whatsoever. And you just stand there in the sky, and kind of look around, and nothing is going on. Which is why you're not supposed to be stoned when you skydive because, [audience laughter] sometimes people tend to forget, you know. So I wrote a poem about it, and, actually it's not...well anything. It's \u201c#9\u201d, is what it is. \n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:15:18\nReads \"#9\" [from File of Uncertainties].\n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:17:31\nAlright, here's another poem from the north--\"#12\".\n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:17:38\nReads \"# 12\".\n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:18:29\nI think I'll just let that go for a minute there and go into some prose and then I'll just read some unpublished poems. This first story that I'm going to read is entitled \"The Tree\", and I wrote it after I met a very lovely old man down in Australia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q408]. Very old. He was an aborigine, and we tried to communicate; he didn't know my language and I didn't know his, which is maybe why we got along so well, but anyway, I built a story up on him. This was on a coral island...of course all islands down there are coral islands. \n \nAnnotationAndreas Schroeder\n00:19:19\nReads \"The Tree\" [from The Late Man].\n \nAudience\n00:25:45\nApplause.\n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:25:54\nHere's another short one, entitled \"The Pub\", sort of a frenzied affair. They don't--it's sort of illegal to have fights in pubs, and in Vancouver I was the very happy observer of one, finally. Pub fights have sort of a beautiful ritualistic thing as long as you're not involved, like if you're just kind of watching, and the Cecil Hotel staged one one night and after that I wrote this, although it has nothing to do with that. \n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:26:23\nReads \"The Pub\" [from The Late Man].\n \nAudience\n00:31:28\nApplause.\n \nEND\n00:31:32\n[Unknown amount of time elapsed before start of next recording].\n\nandreas_schroeder_i006-11-109-4.mp3 [File 4 of 4]\n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:00:00\nReads [\u201cThe Theft\u201d from The Late Man]. \n \nAudience\n00:05:03\nApplause.\n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:05:09\nRight, just one more. This one is, is quite different. Quite different. In fact, if there is such a thing as a manifesto, I guess that's what it is. Or let's say it's a map or something about roughly where I'm at. It's called \"The Cage\".\n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:05:32\nReads \"The Cage\" [from The Late Man]. \n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:15:11\nThat's all. \n \nAudience\n00:15:12\nApplause.\n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:15:19\nI don't know how to get that off. \n \nEND\n00:15:24"

Schroeder grew up on a farm in the Fraser Valley in B.C., until he was fifteen when his family moved to Vancouver. He enrolled in the University of British Columbia\u2019s creative writing program where he studied under Michael Bullock and J. Michael Yates and received his B.A. in 1969. He founded and edited The Journal of Contemporary Literature in Translation (1968-80) and worked as a columnist for the Vancouver Province (1968-73). Schroeder\u2019s first collections of poetry were The ozone minotaur (Sono Nis Press, 1969) and File of uncertainties (Sono Nis Press, 1971), a collection of concrete poetry UNIverse (MassAge Press, 1971) and a collection of short stories, The late man (Sono Nis Press, 1972). Schroeder completed his M.A. in 1972 from the University of British Columbia, and began teaching creative writing at the University of Victoria from 1974-1975. Schroeder was the chair of the Writer\u2019s Union of Canada between 1976-1977. His most popular book was Shaking it rough (Doubleday, 1976), and he has published over twenty books in poetry, fiction, non-fiction, radio drama, journalism, translation and criticism. Schroeder then taught at the University of British Columbia (1985-7) and at Simon Fraser University (1989-90), publishing The Mennonites: a pictorial history of their lives in Canada (Douglas & McIntyre, 1990), Carved from wood: Mission, B.C. 1891-1992 (Mission Foundation, 1991) and Scams, scandals and scullduggery (M & S, 1996). Schroeder worked as the \u201cresident crookologist\u201d or \u201cresident Scam-meister\u201d on the CBC Radio show Basic Black, which produced a few collections of history\u2019s greatest scams, including a children\u2019s book, Scams! (Annick Press, 2004). His most recent publication is Renovating Heaven (Ooolichan, 2008), and he continues to teach and write in B.C."

Their poetry is quite different, as you'll discover. But from my own point of view, they...I owe both of them a debt that is similar in both cases though neither probably knows it. They've made me, in their own ways, rethink my own feelings about  what ought to constitute poetry and poems. And in the case of Maxine Gadd, this thinking went into a review which was then sent to the Firepoint which then folded. So you may never see that. And in the case of Andy Schroeder [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4755619], found its way into a long tape harangue between the two of us on the subject of form in poetry. Which I think is now in the Sir George Williams Library [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5159005], where any of you can endure it if you wish to. At any rate, the first of these poets to read will be Maxine Gadd. There will be a fifteen minute break, and then Andreas Schroeder will read. Maxine. \n \nAudience\n00:01:32\nApplause. \n \nRichard (Dick) Sommer\n00:02:01\nYou're plugged in. \n \nMaxine Gadd\n00:02:03\nOh boy. Can you hear me? I don't know how much projection to do. I don't know how much to talk about the poetry. My connection is very loose to the mainstream I guess, because, I don't know, I'm just not socially related to what's going on maybe in the poetry reading. I guess my identifications with words are somewhat with a West Coast hippie trip. And between the country and the city, the first feeling being, you know, the desire for purity, you know when you're seventeen or eighteen years old and you've figured the country life is it. And later coming to realize the necessity of the communal life and the city. So I think that's a task I'm going to try to set myself right here. I...this...I'm going to read first of all the second \"well\" poem, which I did, experienced in the country, living in the country. I remember the first \"well\" poem, I don't remember where it's gone, because it didn't get published. I disregarded its importance, you know. I tended to take the judgment of editors, and you know, people that set themselves up as authorities, and that's why I'm here, you know. I've kept close enough to them, I guess. I remember the first one went something like, \"Wanting pure water I went to the well\/too wonderful\"...and there was something about the oracle as the bucket clacked. This is the \u201cSecond Well Poem\u201d. \n \nMaxine Gadd\n00:03:57\nReads \"Second Well Poem\" [published later as \u201cWell poem\u201d in Lost Language].\n\nMaxine Gadd\n00:04:41\nWhich is about where I feel right now. But that's about where my connection to poetry is right now. I wonder if that...I wonder if that one's around. I don't think it is. I guess I'll just take it as it comes. There's some scheme in this. I guess, I got published by a cat, by bill bissett [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4911496] you might have heard, who did the thing, did the guru thing, the super-energy thing of getting a lot of work done, and getting a lot of people's work out, and a lot of his work out, a lot of it was real shit but he got it out, you know, and some of it worked and some of it didn't, but there was so much of it, you know...I'd like to have had that confidence, you know, I guess almost, most people write poetry, they've got it all in their trunk, you know, they don't get it out. But I guess that's what it takes. This is from one of his first, really cheap magazines. He put, he...it's typed, you know. Pretty good typing. His typing got worse, I get very angry, he makes lots of mistakes. But he did a lot of drawings and things, if anybody wants to look at it, you know.  I mean, he did it minimum, you know, he was living really poor. And a lot of people still read his stuff, so, I mean, to me he was a folk poet in that sense, a lot of people still read his stuff because he got the stuff out cheap, you know. \"Trip\".\n \nMaxine Gadd\n00:06:05\nReads \"Trip\".\n \nMaxine Gadd\n00:07:47\nI'm going to go over there. This one is to a poet who is in the, is in another world, okay? He looks like a silver lizard, and he's very beautiful, and he knows all about the Greek trip, and Eleusis, which is one's talking about in the first poem, okay, the oracles from under the ground, that belief you must start out with. It's called...and it's admiration, as well as a bit of terror.\n \nMaxine Gadd\n00:08:22\nReads unnamed poem. \n \nMaxine Gadd\n00:10:19\nLeary, I should have mentioned, was Timothy Leary. Oh, I should have explained that before, yeah. Oh yeah, this is where I met...now I don't like it okay? And it's probably not a good poem. But that's, that's...you know, that's...the kind of art form I'd like to have seen as a collective art form, was what I yearned and hoped for. Poetry is what people write in rooms alone, and I don't like...I don't, you know, that's what I was stuck with. And I worked for a while with a group in Vancouver called, named, we called it \"Intermedia\". And I had the experience of working with a group, at one point there were five of us poets, you know, or what we called poets. And we'd go around to various places, we went to Edmonton [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2096] one time, and we tried things, we tried chanting and wailing, like, was it...who was that crazy old lady. Sitwell, Edith Sitwell [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q259921], remember her? And if you ever heard the sort of sing, the song, sing sing she used to do, you know, we tried that. And it really worked, you know, but you'd go around and you'd say, \"Do you dig the poems?\" and they'd say, \"I can't hear them, but we really like your voice.\" You know. [Audience laughter].

Here's one from last year. I got into printing stuff myself, you know, and I do that--I wish, oh, you can't see it, can you? It was mimeograph, it was real cheap, you know? And you could take images, you could take newspaper articles, you could take scraps of anything you saw that you dug, you know, put 'em together, and to me that was a, that was a form of concrete poetry. Can't, of course, I don't know, you couldn't really say that one or any number of them. This one is half-said, okay. Behind it I put a map, I found a map of B.C. [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1974]and Minster Island [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q21906024] was a map, was an island I found once when I was working on a ship as a mess girl, on a freighter. \n \nMaxine Gadd\n00:13:46\nReads unnamed poem.\n \nMaxine Gadd\n00:15:33\nAnd where that ended up was just over the name Bella Coola [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q815765], which is sort of where they do, can fish. There's no escape, though, you know? And...so then I want to read about Kitsilano [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4179275], where most of...I happened, you know, I grew up. Kitsilano's a sort of slum district of Vancouver. And it's disintegrating, and you probably all experienced this, you know, being city people, you know, they're bulldozing the places, there's no more cheap places to live, and so your friends, you know, you can't live there anymore, your friends can't live there anymore, so whatever you had, which was sometimes very heavy, you know, community's really beautiful, you know? I used to go over and play music with my friends. We had to move out, you know, because the city's being destroyed, and only the people who are well-to-do, who have some sort of stake in the city, you know, who are supporting the structure can stay. And this poem is about somebody who I met one day on the street, you know, and her story, she's sort of sick, just on the street, everything's falling to pieces. \n \nMaxine Gadd\n00:16:55\nReads \u201cbee-people on 4th avenue\u201d [published later in Lost Language].\n\nMaxine Gadd\n00:18:32\nWho's singing out there?

And, you know, we're about the same age, and we've been through a lot of things, and, we've been through some bad things, you know, lots of rejections and refusal, no, there's no food now, you can't have any, go away, you know, fighting over somebody or other. \n \nMaxine Gadd\n00:18:58\nReads \u201c4th ave\u201d [published later in Lost Language].\n \nMaxine Gadd\n00:20:49\nUs old ladies.

It'll be up to Andy. I'd like to introduce to you Andy Schroeder.\n \nAudience\n00:00:15\nApplause.\n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:00:40\nRight. Normally they hang you after a reading. Jesus. I'm going to read from, oh, just kind of a merry jaunt through various books. I think what I'll do is I'll read some of the, some poetry first, and then I'll slip over into fiction. I've just, two days ago, published a book called The Late Man of short fictions and extended prose poems and so on. The work that I've done is gone cyclic in terms of form. I started out with prose poems and went into much more of a linear poetry, and then went back to a fiction which was kind of a half prose poem, half short story, half God knows, film script. And right now I'm working hard at both styles. First book I published was called The Ozone Minotaur, and it was more surreal than anything I'm doing now. I really get very excited about illusions, and I guess that's probably what most of my work is all about. At first I was very interested in surreal illusions; now I'm very interested in real illusions, and I'm not sure there's any difference. Here's a prose poem from way back called \"Introduction\".\n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:02:10\nReads \"Introduction\" from The Ozone Minotaur.\n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:03:15\nAfter I found out that you couldn't live by writing poetry, I took a job with CPAir [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q986941]. That doesn't really sound like a very logical progression, but anyway, it was a teletype machine that they put me on, I think I lasted about four days, but I got a poem out of it, and it's entitled \"Cables\".\n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:03:35\nReads \"Cables\" [from The Ozone Minotaur].\n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:05:29\nThis next book, File of Uncertainties, I supposed was kind of created when I woke up one morning and was overwhelmed with my own ignorance, so I decided to write a book about it. [Audience laughter]. And then I figured the best way to do it was to go up north and I did that, and I spent a winter up in Alaska [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q797]. And that was where I really got into this illusion thing, because, you know, all the different, very very strange things that happen there, like white-outs, which you probably are familiar with here, as well, where a man suddenly loses all sense of up and down and forward and backward. They have better ones than that, though. They have, until the snowmobile rolls around, when people used to mush with dogs, they'd continually have this happening: a man would set off from one village for another, with his dogs, and he'd be perfectly well-dressed and perfectly well-fed, and apparently perfectly sane, and the dogs would arrive, and the sled would arrive but the man wouldn't, and they possibly found him and possibly not. But no one could ever understand what would make a man suddenly step off his sleigh and walk off in an entirely different direction to die. When he certainly didn't have it on his list of things to do when he left. They still haven't figured that out. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that man's body is made up of such an incredible percentage of water, and very strange things happen to water up there. [Audience laughter]. Anyway, I almost got caught by an avalanche, so I thought I'd check into it and I'd find out what you do if you do get caught by one, cause I figured by that time that survival was probably a good thing. So, they said, one of the things you do is, if you get caught by an avalanche, you make swimming motions with your hands. I guess the idea is that kind of tends to keep you close to the surface, which is a good place to be. Now...[audience laughter] the lovely illusion part, which really intrigued me, was that a man can survive under the snow up to a depth of approximately six feet, but only for a certain period of time, and apparently the closer you are to the surface, the better your chances are, and the way they dig for, well, it's not necessarily logical up there, at least it didn't seem like it, but the way they dig for a man like this is they use sounding rods, and these are very sensitive rods, like, almost like tuning forks, and they walk along, in a very definite rhythm, it's almost like a musical score, and they ram these poles in, one foot deep, about a foot at a time, and attempt to hit somebody that's buried underneath it. And then they go back again and they do it at two feet, and then at three feet and four feet to six feet, they don't go any deeper. Now the peculiar part of it is that they of course can't hear anyone, but the poor bugger that's under the snow can hear very, very clearly. And, you know, and he'll hear people saying, like I wonder where, I think there's a place he might be, and he'll be shouting in there, saying, \"I'm here,\" you know, \"I'm here!\" and they can't hear him, and it's really quite terrifying. Sound only travels one way through an avalanche, I don't...[Audience laughter]. Anyway, I'll, let me read some poems about it, I'll...File of Uncertainties was written in a very short time and mostly about the same thing, and you'll find recurring images all the way through, stylistic things that are similar all the way through, and the poems, because they match together fairly tightly, I didn't even bother naming them, I just numbered them, because they're all part of the same sequence. This is number four. \n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:09:27\nReads \"File of Uncertainties: #4\" from File of Uncertainties.\n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:10:25\nReads \"File of Uncertainties: #3\" from File of Uncertainties.\n\nAndreas Schroeder\n00:12:13\nReads \"File of Uncertainties: #5\" from File of Uncertainties.\n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:12:54\nReads \"File of Uncertainties: #8\" from File of Uncertainties.\n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:13:50\nI took up sky-diving after I came back and, because...yeah, believe it or not, it had very similar illusions going for it again. When...it's much like the white-out. When you jump off an aircraft, and it banks away, generally to your left, then you suddenly lose all points of reference. And because the earth below you is much too far away to really mean anything, and your parachute is still on your back, in other words not opened, so you can't, you haven't got anything above you either, you suddenly get hit with this incredibly stony silence, and absolutely nothing happens. I mean, you don't fall, you're not moving, you're not even really thinking because it's so suddenly quiet. It seems like everything just freezes. And in fact you're falling at about three hundred feet a second, but you have no sense of it whatsoever. And you just stand there in the sky, and kind of look around, and nothing is going on. Which is why you're not supposed to be stoned when you skydive because, [audience laughter] sometimes people tend to forget, you know. So I wrote a poem about it, and, actually it's not...well anything. It's \u201c#9\u201d, is what it is. \n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:15:18\nReads \"#9\" [from File of Uncertainties].\n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:17:31\nAlright, here's another poem from the north--\"#12\".\n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:17:38\nReads \"# 12\".\n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:18:29\nI think I'll just let that go for a minute there and go into some prose and then I'll just read some unpublished poems. This first story that I'm going to read is entitled \"The Tree\", and I wrote it after I met a very lovely old man down in Australia [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q408]. Very old. He was an aborigine, and we tried to communicate; he didn't know my language and I didn't know his, which is maybe why we got along so well, but anyway, I built a story up on him. This was on a coral island...of course all islands down there are coral islands. \n \nAnnotationAndreas Schroeder\n00:19:19\nReads \"The Tree\" [from The Late Man].\n \nAudience\n00:25:45\nApplause.\n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:25:54\nHere's another short one, entitled \"The Pub\", sort of a frenzied affair. They don't--it's sort of illegal to have fights in pubs, and in Vancouver I was the very happy observer of one, finally. Pub fights have sort of a beautiful ritualistic thing as long as you're not involved, like if you're just kind of watching, and the Cecil Hotel staged one one night and after that I wrote this, although it has nothing to do with that. \n \nAndreas Schroeder\n00:26:23\nReads \"The Pub\" [from The Late Man].\n \nAudience\n00:31:28\nApplause.\n \nEND\n00:31:32\n[Unknown amount of time elapsed before start of next recording].",

            "contents": "chris_levenson_i006-11-104-1.mp3 [File 1 of 2]\n\nIntroducer\n00:00:00\nAbout seven years ago, our lives intersected for about two years at the University of Iowa [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q182973], where Christopher [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5112730], along with two or three other poets suddenly arrived, in that middle state [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1546?wprov=srpw1_0] in the United States [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30?wprov=srpw1_0], with not just English accents, but a whole body of literatures and languages behind them. Christopher was not just in the poetry workshop, but was doing a lot of translations from German and Dutch, writing his own poetry, was a kind of formidable character with these obscure languages, at least obscure to me at the time. He has since come on, after doing his Ph.D. at Carleton [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1041737] where he is an Assistant Professor of English. His third book of poems, Stills, is being published in the next few weeks by Chatto and Windus [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3666843], and should be looked for at your bookstores. He's asked for it to come but it hasn't arrived yet. So without any further delay, Christopher Levenson. \n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:01:54\nGood evening. Trying to decide what I'm going to read this evening, presents the same sort of problems that it always does, when one's being asked to divide oneself up into certain sections, decide which poems you like best, and you know, you love them all, and don't want to make any choices. And to find some headings, some pigeonholes. Well, I'm not very good at this, but I'll start off with a few poems about the United States, about Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16?wprov=srpw1_0], starting off with places, and then move on to some slightly more personal ones, before the interval. Alright, the first poem I want to read is called \"Modus Vivendi\", which, it sounds a bit affected, having a foreign language titles, but I felt this said a little bit more than simply 'way of life' because \u2018modus vivendi\u2019 implies something very transitory, and that was one of the aspects of my first impressions at least of American life, that struck me very forcibly, this really came out of my very first day in the States, traveling from New York [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60] to Chicago [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1297?wprov=srpw1_0] by train.\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:03:42\nReads \"Modus Vivendi\" [from Cairns].\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:05:20\nThen, a poem that will be in stills called \"Metropolis\". Well I think this is self-explanatory, and in fact one of reasons why I like reading aloud, is because a fair number of my poems are self-explanatory and don't have to say too much about them. So I won't. \"Metropolis\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:05:49\nReads \"Metropolis\" [from Stills].\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:06:57\nThat, I suppose, really brands me as--emotionally speaking, as a European, because it's different here in Montreal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q340]. I've not been to Quebec [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2145] yet, it's different in one or two places, but on the whole, you know, I find myself looking in vain for this sense of a centre. Now, a poem that I wrote not too long ago in Ottawa [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1930]. Called \"Office\", it's a shorter one. Sort this out a bit. Last time I gave a reading, somebody knocked water all over it. Here we go.\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:07:54\nReads \"Office\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:08:15\nAnd then one which is my main claim so far, I suppose, to writing a Canadian poem, \"Horse Sleigh\", certainly it's not one that I could have written anywhere else. One of the kids is at nursery school and they take them out each winter on a horse sleigh ride, and I went along. So, of course, it's not really about a horse sleigh.  One word- half way through, the word 'revenants' these are ghosts that come back to their own--literally, their old haunts. And can't seem to keep away from the place. \"Horse Sleigh\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:09:07\nReads \"Horse Sleigh\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:09:57\nThen, another poem, based pretty obviously I think on personal experience, in the States. It's called \"A Bad Trip\", not mine, somebody else's, but this would be, this I felt was sort of enough to keep me off it. Anyway, \"A Bad Trip\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:10:34\nReads \"A Bad Trip\" [from Stills].\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:12:26\nThen, one which came a long, long time after I was actually told of this incident by my wife in fact, and it must be something like 1956, actually it happened, a carnival referred to is a German carnival, and I guess things have changed quite a bit since then. \"Song of the Unmarried Mother\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:13:00\nReads \"Song of the Unmarried Mother\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:14:28\nThen maybe have a little bit of pseudo light relief before we go on. \"Ballad of the Psycho-Analyst\". Which is another, sort of relic, but again not a personal one, this started off as a fine number of my poems do from things people say to me. The first two lines here, \"They took me across the river, they laid me up the hill\", were almost exactly what somebody said. And I took it from there. Alright, \"The Ballad of the Psycho-Analyst\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:15:07\nReads \"The Ballad of the Psycho-Analyst\" [from Cairns].\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:16:54\nAnd, I'll read a couple more, sort of more personal ones, I guess. Well, this isn't really, this poem called \"Old Friend\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:17:16\nReads \"Old Friend\" [from Stills].\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:19:11\nAnd, \"Maps\". I've always been fascinated by maps and I find looking through my poems, certain images keep on recurring. One of them is that of maps, another one, as maybe you'll see later, is of stones, [unintelligible] and so on. And what I'm referring to in the first section here are these old maps where great chunks have come true and not known and so they just put in a zephyr, a wind, you know, or a dragon, or a dolphin or something like that to  make up for their ignorance. \"Maps\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:19:58\nReads \"Maps\" [from Stills].\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:21:29\nThen, a thing in this first part, I'll just read. One found poem, and then two excerpts from a sort of longer work in process. The found poem, I dedicate to Howard and [Marty (?)] Fink because that's where I found it. It's called the \"Bowfoot Scale\". The beaufort scale is simply an explanation in terms of miles per hour, I've left that column out, and in terms of symptoms so to speak of these words that you hear on the weather reports, calm, slight breeze and so forth. \"Beaufort Scale\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:22:21\nReads \"Beaufort Scale\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:23:31\n[Laughter]. I dare say it's a found poem. It's not really mine. I get a lot of fun out of finding poems. Now these next two excerpts are from a poem which is tentatively entitled, \"Hopkins in Piccadilly\", it won't be called that in the end, it's just, it started off thinking what Gerard Manley Hopkins [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q313693] would think of contemporary London [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q84], but it soon left that idea behind and what it's going to be now is a poem in several sections about various aspects of London. Trying to use as many words in my poems that I don't normally use in poems, you know, or that one does not normally see used in poems, and so a lot of, words which are not normally part of my poetic vocabulary. I'm not trying to be arch or archaic or anything like that, simply to expand my vocabulary and, hope to, therefore, I can say new things. Now the two that I've got semi finished, or at least enough to read, one's called \"Charing Cross Road\", if you know London, England [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q21], you'll know that this is the road in which you find both some very good book shops and a lot of very sleazy so called hygienic stores, and it's this aspect I'm concentrating on there, and then the second one is on Hyde Park [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q123738], with the idea of the public speakers and the orators. \"Charing Cross Road\" then.\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:25:25\nReads \"Charing Cross Road\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:26:34\nThat's as far as I've got with that bit so far. The next one, \"Hyde Park\", the Hyde Park Speaker's Corner [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q510323] is what I'm thinking of particularly.\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:26:47\nReads \"Hyde Park\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:28:41\nIt's not really supposed to follow quite on from that, but a little bit later. \"But still at least we have our language...\"\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:28:48\nResumes reading \u201cHyde Park\u201d.\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:29:08\nThat's as far as I've got with that section too for the moment. And I believe the custom is, sometimes, at least, here to have a sort of five or ten minute break and then we will have about another twenty minutes afterwards, if that's alright with you.\n\nUnknown\n00:30:22\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n\nChristopher Levenson\n00:30:23\nI'll read a few so called political poems, they're not really political in the normal sense, not sort of party political or anything like that, simply concerned about relationships between people in the community or sort of national attitudes, that sort of thing, more than specific political issues. Although this first one that I'm going to read, \"Terrorist\", comes, I think, fairly obviously from a particular situation, with which you here are particularly well acquainted. I was thinking, particularly of the FLQ [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1129564] crisis [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q27702], but it could apply to any terrorist.\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:31:31\nReads \"Terrorist\" [published later in The Journey Back].\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:32:35\nI suppose if I have a recurring theme in these quasi-political poems, it is that, the tyranny of the ideal if you like, the way in which we force things to become what we want them to become. Force ourselves to see things so that they fit into our pre-selected beliefs. Alright, a rather different sort of poem called \"The Facts of Life\".  This too will be in the book.\n\nChristopher Levenson\n00:33:13\nReads \"The Facts of Life\" [from Stills].\n \nEND\n00:35:25\n\n\nchris_levenson_i006-11-104-2.mp3 [File 2 of 2] \n\nChristopher Levenson\n00:00:00\nResumes reading \"The Facts of Life\" [from Stills].\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:00:59\nAnd another poem that comes from the same sort of period, as I said, I like finding poems, and this one I found in the window of a pharmacy, this time they had notices saying 'watch for these danger signs', they were danger signs of cancer, and I call this little poem, which is, as I say, a political poem, so I won't explain the metaphor any further, \"Introduction to Cancer Diagnosis\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:01:32\nReads \"Introduction to Cancer Diagnosis\" [from Stills].\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:02:17\nAnother poem, \"Epitaph for a Killer\", I think you will probably remember the incident this starts from. Charles Whitman [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q453209] going up the University library tower [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q28403236] in Austin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16559], Texas and just picking a few people off with his telescopic lens gun. And the thing that struck me when I read these reports, as it so often happened with Richard Speck [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q944350] and all those other sort of, mass killers, that people said, 'oh, but he was such a nice boy, such an ordinary boy' you know, 'such a decent lad'. You know, how could anyone so ordinary, you know if he had long hair, or if he'd been a hippie, we would have expected it. But you know, because they didn't go 'round the little- labels on them, they were expected to have conformed completely, and of course they didn't. \"Epitaph for a Killer\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:03:32\nReads \"Epitaph for a Killer\" [from Stills].\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:04:49\nI always forget until I finish reading that poem that that last line is not self-explanatory. It's a disease--I think it's called Sickle disease--Pardon? [audience member addresses Levenson]. Sickle Cell Disease [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q185034], okay. Which apparently affects mainly African Negroes, and this is some sort of deficiency in the blood quite simply, but something which is totally inexplicable in the genes anyway. Alright, another, one more sort of pseudo or quasi political poem, this one is called \"Boreland Burlap\". Again, I don't know if you know exactly what I am referring to, but I think the poem explains it sufficiently, the way you get trees transplanted whole nowadays.\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:06:05\nReads \"Boreland Burlap\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:07:05\nAnd now, a section of poems, well, I've put ironically, self-ironically, \"The Solution\" I mean, having presented some political problems--of course, there are no solutions. What I've tried to do in some of the poems I'm going to read now is simply to capture certain textures, or to suggest certain qualities that I admire, or certain aspects of character. The first, well I think probably the only rock poem I'm going to read this evening, called \"Fossil\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:07:57\nReads \"Fossil\" [from Cairns].\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:08:50\nThen, a short little poem called \"Moss\", I've got to find it. Well, come back to that in a minute as they say on CBC [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q461761]. Oh here we are, I think, no. Yes, there we are, \"Moss\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:09:22\nReads \"Moss\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:09:44\nAnd now, \"Skyscraper\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:09:54\nReads \"Skyscraper\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:10:22\n\"Mediation on Trees\". This too, part of it is found, so to speak, found of all places, in 'Life\u2019 [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q463198]. The magazine 'Life', an article about a Japanese wood carver, and I'll try to indicate by the tone of my voice, which are the quotations, the rest of it's me of course. \"Meditation on Trees\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:11:03\nReads \"Meditation on Trees\" [published later in The Journey Back].\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:12:57\nI just realized, I mentioned to one or two people that I was going to read a poem called \"Ottawa\" and I haven't read it, so I'll slip it in now.\n\nChristopher Levenson\n00:13:07\nReads \"Ottawa\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:13:41\nAnother poem called \"The Face of Holland\", again concerned with certain characteristics, here I'm trying to identify national characteristics and the various sort of puns, hereto--I think the only thing I need to explain perhaps are the polders of course the land that originally reclaimed by the sea and now enclosed by dykes. I think the rest of it's self-explanatory.\n\nChristopher Levenson\n00:14:19\nReads \"The Face of Holland\" [published later in The Journey Back].\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:15:47\nI think I'll read three more poems if you bear with me, these come under the general heading of 'Art', really the relationship of art to life, though this first one is at least, would-be light poem, called \"The Quartet\", to Carleton, where I teach now. We have a series of concerts in the winter, and most of them are pretty good but one particular one wasn't and it set me thinking about the whole marvelous artificiality of chamber music in a way.\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:16:37\nReads \"The Quartet\" [from Stills].\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:18:14\nThen, a poem called \"Watch the Birdie\" which is about the cost of art in human terms. If you know what a sea urchin is like in its natural and in its final state, final [unintelligible] state, it'll help. You know they're all, like, sort of hedgehogs or porcupines and you have to scrape all the spines off and then gauge the insides out, but that's described in lurid detail.\n\nChristopher Levenson\n00:19:02\nReads \"Watch the Birdie\" [from Stills].\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:20:18\nThat sounds a bit pretentious, I'm afraid, those last four words in Latin, but it means \"you also\", or \"you likewise\", and I know gulls' cries don't really sound like that but, that seemed to me the briefest most concise way of making that point at the end of the poem. Finally, a poem which attempts to link love and art. Called \"Bathysphere\", or rather the kind of knowledge involved in both.\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:21:11\nReads \"Bathysphere\" [published later in Into The Open].\n \nEND\n00:22:51\n"

Charles Whitman [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q453209] going up the University library tower [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q28403236] in Austin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16559], Texas and just picking a few people off with his telescopic lens gun. And the thing that struck me when I read these reports, as it so often happened with Richard Speck [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q944350] and all those other sort of, mass killers, that people said, 'oh, but he was such a nice boy, such an ordinary boy' you know, 'such a decent lad'. You know, how could anyone so ordinary, you know if he had long hair, or if he'd been a hippie, we would have expected it. But you know, because they didn't go 'round the little- labels on them, they were expected to have conformed completely, and of course they didn't. \"Epitaph for a Killer\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:03:32\nReads \"Epitaph for a Killer\" [from Stills].\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:04:49\nI always forget until I finish reading that poem that that last line is not self-explanatory. It's a disease--I think it's called Sickle disease--Pardon? [audience member addresses Levenson]. Sickle Cell Disease [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q185034], okay. Which apparently affects mainly African Negroes, and this is some sort of deficiency in the blood quite simply, but something which is totally inexplicable in the genes anyway. Alright, another, one more sort of pseudo or quasi political poem, this one is called \"Boreland Burlap\". Again, I don't know if you know exactly what I am referring to, but I think the poem explains it sufficiently, the way you get trees transplanted whole nowadays.\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:06:05\nReads \"Boreland Burlap\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:07:05\nAnd now, a section of poems, well, I've put ironically, self-ironically, \"The Solution\" I mean, having presented some political problems--of course, there are no solutions. What I've tried to do in some of the poems I'm going to read now is simply to capture certain textures, or to suggest certain qualities that I admire, or certain aspects of character. The first, well I think probably the only rock poem I'm going to read this evening, called \"Fossil\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:07:57\nReads \"Fossil\" [from Cairns].\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:08:50\nThen, a short little poem called \"Moss\", I've got to find it. Well, come back to that in a minute as they say on CBC [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q461761]. Oh here we are, I think, no. Yes, there we are, \"Moss\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:09:22\nReads \"Moss\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:09:44\nAnd now, \"Skyscraper\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:09:54\nReads \"Skyscraper\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:10:22\n\"Mediation on Trees\". This too, part of it is found, so to speak, found of all places, in 'Life\u2019 [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q463198]. The magazine 'Life', an article about a Japanese wood carver, and I'll try to indicate by the tone of my voice, which are the quotations, the rest of it's me of course. \"Meditation on Trees\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:11:03\nReads \"Meditation on Trees\" [published later in The Journey Back].\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:12:57\nI just realized, I mentioned to one or two people that I was going to read a poem called \"Ottawa\" and I haven't read it, so I'll slip it in now.\n\nChristopher Levenson\n00:13:07\nReads \"Ottawa\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:13:41\nAnother poem called \"The Face of Holland\", again concerned with certain characteristics, here I'm trying to identify national characteristics and the various sort of puns, hereto--I think the only thing I need to explain perhaps are the polders of course the land that originally reclaimed by the sea and now enclosed by dykes. I think the rest of it's self-explanatory.\n\nChristopher Levenson\n00:14:19\nReads \"The Face of Holland\" [published later in The Journey Back].\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:15:47\nI think I'll read three more poems if you bear with me, these come under the general heading of 'Art', really the relationship of art to life, though this first one is at least, would-be light poem, called \"The Quartet\", to Carleton, where I teach now. We have a series of concerts in the winter, and most of them are pretty good but one particular one wasn't and it set me thinking about the whole marvelous artificiality of chamber music in a way.\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:16:37\nReads \"The Quartet\" [from Stills].\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:18:14\nThen, a poem called \"Watch the Birdie\" which is about the cost of art in human terms. If you know what a sea urchin is like in its natural and in its final state, final [unintelligible] state, it'll help. You know they're all, like, sort of hedgehogs or porcupines and you have to scrape all the spines off and then gauge the insides out, but that's described in lurid detail.\n\nChristopher Levenson\n00:19:02\nReads \"Watch the Birdie\" [from Stills].\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:20:18\nThat sounds a bit pretentious, I'm afraid, those last four words in Latin, but it means \"you also\", or \"you likewise\", and I know gulls' cries don't really sound like that but, that seemed to me the briefest most concise way of making that point at the end of the poem. Finally, a poem which attempts to link love and art. Called \"Bathysphere\", or rather the kind of knowledge involved in both.\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:21:11\nReads \"Bathysphere\" [published later in Into The Open].\n \nEND\n00:22:51\n",

                "contents": "chris_levenson_i006-11-104-1.mp3 [File 1 of 2]\n\nIntroducer\n00:00:00\nAbout seven years ago, our lives intersected for about two years at the University of Iowa [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q182973], where Christopher [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5112730], along with two or three other poets suddenly arrived, in that middle state [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1546?wprov=srpw1_0] in the United States [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30?wprov=srpw1_0], with not just English accents, but a whole body of literatures and languages behind them. Christopher was not just in the poetry workshop, but was doing a lot of translations from German and Dutch, writing his own poetry, was a kind of formidable character with these obscure languages, at least obscure to me at the time. He has since come on, after doing his Ph.D. at Carleton [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1041737] where he is an Assistant Professor of English. His third book of poems, Stills, is being published in the next few weeks by Chatto and Windus [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3666843], and should be looked for at your bookstores. He's asked for it to come but it hasn't arrived yet. So without any further delay, Christopher Levenson. \n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:01:54\nGood evening. Trying to decide what I'm going to read this evening, presents the same sort of problems that it always does, when one's being asked to divide oneself up into certain sections, decide which poems you like best, and you know, you love them all, and don't want to make any choices. And to find some headings, some pigeonholes. Well, I'm not very good at this, but I'll start off with a few poems about the United States, about Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16?wprov=srpw1_0], starting off with places, and then move on to some slightly more personal ones, before the interval. Alright, the first poem I want to read is called \"Modus Vivendi\", which, it sounds a bit affected, having a foreign language titles, but I felt this said a little bit more than simply 'way of life' because \u2018modus vivendi\u2019 implies something very transitory, and that was one of the aspects of my first impressions at least of American life, that struck me very forcibly, this really came out of my very first day in the States, traveling from New York [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60] to Chicago [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1297?wprov=srpw1_0] by train.\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:03:42\nReads \"Modus Vivendi\" [from Cairns].\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:05:20\nThen, a poem that will be in stills called \"Metropolis\". Well I think this is self-explanatory, and in fact one of reasons why I like reading aloud, is because a fair number of my poems are self-explanatory and don't have to say too much about them. So I won't. \"Metropolis\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:05:49\nReads \"Metropolis\" [from Stills].\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:06:57\nThat, I suppose, really brands me as--emotionally speaking, as a European, because it's different here in Montreal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q340]. I've not been to Quebec [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2145] yet, it's different in one or two places, but on the whole, you know, I find myself looking in vain for this sense of a centre. Now, a poem that I wrote not too long ago in Ottawa [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1930]. Called \"Office\", it's a shorter one. Sort this out a bit. Last time I gave a reading, somebody knocked water all over it. Here we go.\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:07:54\nReads \"Office\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:08:15\nAnd then one which is my main claim so far, I suppose, to writing a Canadian poem, \"Horse Sleigh\", certainly it's not one that I could have written anywhere else. One of the kids is at nursery school and they take them out each winter on a horse sleigh ride, and I went along. So, of course, it's not really about a horse sleigh.  One word- half way through, the word 'revenants' these are ghosts that come back to their own--literally, their old haunts. And can't seem to keep away from the place. \"Horse Sleigh\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:09:07\nReads \"Horse Sleigh\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:09:57\nThen, another poem, based pretty obviously I think on personal experience, in the States. It's called \"A Bad Trip\", not mine, somebody else's, but this would be, this I felt was sort of enough to keep me off it. Anyway, \"A Bad Trip\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:10:34\nReads \"A Bad Trip\" [from Stills].\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:12:26\nThen, one which came a long, long time after I was actually told of this incident by my wife in fact, and it must be something like 1956, actually it happened, a carnival referred to is a German carnival, and I guess things have changed quite a bit since then. \"Song of the Unmarried Mother\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:13:00\nReads \"Song of the Unmarried Mother\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:14:28\nThen maybe have a little bit of pseudo light relief before we go on. \"Ballad of the Psycho-Analyst\". Which is another, sort of relic, but again not a personal one, this started off as a fine number of my poems do from things people say to me. The first two lines here, \"They took me across the river, they laid me up the hill\", were almost exactly what somebody said. And I took it from there. Alright, \"The Ballad of the Psycho-Analyst\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:15:07\nReads \"The Ballad of the Psycho-Analyst\" [from Cairns].\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:16:54\nAnd, I'll read a couple more, sort of more personal ones, I guess. Well, this isn't really, this poem called \"Old Friend\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:17:16\nReads \"Old Friend\" [from Stills].\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:19:11\nAnd, \"Maps\". I've always been fascinated by maps and I find looking through my poems, certain images keep on recurring. One of them is that of maps, another one, as maybe you'll see later, is of stones, [unintelligible] and so on. And what I'm referring to in the first section here are these old maps where great chunks have come true and not known and so they just put in a zephyr, a wind, you know, or a dragon, or a dolphin or something like that to  make up for their ignorance. \"Maps\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:19:58\nReads \"Maps\" [from Stills].\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:21:29\nThen, a thing in this first part, I'll just read. One found poem, and then two excerpts from a sort of longer work in process. The found poem, I dedicate to Howard and [Marty (?)] Fink because that's where I found it. It's called the \"Bowfoot Scale\". The beaufort scale is simply an explanation in terms of miles per hour, I've left that column out, and in terms of symptoms so to speak of these words that you hear on the weather reports, calm, slight breeze and so forth. \"Beaufort Scale\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:22:21\nReads \"Beaufort Scale\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:23:31\n[Laughter]. I dare say it's a found poem. It's not really mine. I get a lot of fun out of finding poems. Now these next two excerpts are from a poem which is tentatively entitled, \"Hopkins in Piccadilly\", it won't be called that in the end, it's just, it started off thinking what Gerard Manley Hopkins [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q313693] would think of contemporary London [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q84], but it soon left that idea behind and what it's going to be now is a poem in several sections about various aspects of London. Trying to use as many words in my poems that I don't normally use in poems, you know, or that one does not normally see used in poems, and so a lot of, words which are not normally part of my poetic vocabulary. I'm not trying to be arch or archaic or anything like that, simply to expand my vocabulary and, hope to, therefore, I can say new things. Now the two that I've got semi finished, or at least enough to read, one's called \"Charing Cross Road\", if you know London, England [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q21], you'll know that this is the road in which you find both some very good book shops and a lot of very sleazy so called hygienic stores, and it's this aspect I'm concentrating on there, and then the second one is on Hyde Park [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q123738], with the idea of the public speakers and the orators. \"Charing Cross Road\" then.\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:25:25\nReads \"Charing Cross Road\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:26:34\nThat's as far as I've got with that bit so far. The next one, \"Hyde Park\", the Hyde Park Speaker's Corner [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q510323] is what I'm thinking of particularly.\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:26:47\nReads \"Hyde Park\".\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:28:41\nIt's not really supposed to follow quite on from that, but a little bit later. \"But still at least we have our language...\"\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:28:48\nResumes reading \u201cHyde Park\u201d.\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:29:08\nThat's as far as I've got with that section too for the moment. And I believe the custom is, sometimes, at least, here to have a sort of five or ten minute break and then we will have about another twenty minutes afterwards, if that's alright with you.\n\nUnknown\n00:30:22\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n\nChristopher Levenson\n00:30:23\nI'll read a few so called political poems, they're not really political in the normal sense, not sort of party political or anything like that, simply concerned about relationships between people in the community or sort of national attitudes, that sort of thing, more than specific political issues. Although this first one that I'm going to read, \"Terrorist\", comes, I think, fairly obviously from a particular situation, with which you here are particularly well acquainted. I was thinking, particularly of the FLQ [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1129564] crisis [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q27702], but it could apply to any terrorist.\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:31:31\nReads \"Terrorist\" [published later in The Journey Back].\n \nChristopher Levenson\n00:32:35\nI suppose if I have a recurring theme in these quasi-political poems, it is that, the tyranny of the ideal if you like, the way in which we force things to become what we want them to become. Force ourselves to see things so that they fit into our pre-selected beliefs. Alright, a rather different sort of poem called \"The Facts of Life\".  This too will be in the book.\n\nChristopher Levenson\n00:33:13\nReads \"The Facts of Life\" [from Stills].\n \nEND\n00:35:25\n",

            "contents": "le_sissman_i006-11-110.mp3\n\nStanton Hoffman\n00:00:00\nL.E. Sissman's three books of poems are Dying: An Introduction, Scattered Returns and Pursuit of Honor. The poet James Atlas made the following observation about Scattered Returns that it \"engages a voice so casual, so tuneless that the depression which pervades each page is in danger of being overlooked. Not the shrill agony of despair, but the flat surfaces of the unfulfilled or what characterizes his diction\". But also I'd like to take a line from a Sissman poem out of context, \"evidently, even desperation leads a charmed life\". Ladies and gentleman, L.E. Sissman.\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:00:45\nThank you. Well let me begin by refuting one of those statements that Stanley just made, Stanton, I'm sorry, just made. I was not a singing vacuum cleaner salesman, that was a canard that was incorporated into my vita by my publisher, who misread a biographical note I wrote. I once worked for a vacuum cleaner company that made its salesmen sing pep songs before they went out to tackle the ladies in the neighbourhood, so we'd get up in the morning and sing all these ridiculous songs and then go out and try to sell vacuum cleaners but the two were not really related, it was just hyping oneself up for the gritty day of trying to sell these poor ladies on a vacuum cleaner. Now I've seen you've kindly reproduced, and incidentally you've been most kind here in Montreal, I've been received royally, more so than any place I've been lately to read poetry and I greatly appreciated, I feel it's kind of a homecoming since my mother is a Canadian, from Ontario [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1904], not Quebec [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q176], but I've been in Montreal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q34] many times before and I'm very fond of this city and if I finally lose patience with the U. S. and A. [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30] as Walt Kelly [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q933892] says in Pogo [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2100584] I'll migrate up here, I feel it an eminently sensible thing to do. So it's nice to have a pleasant reception here. And since you've kindly reproduced one of the poems from a group called \"Mouth Organ Tunes: the American Lost-and-Found\" on your mimeographed sheet, I thought I'd start off by reading that poem. I'm going to say a few words at the risk of being dull about what each one of these poems I'm going to read is for, what I meant it to mean. This particular one is talking about the well, kind of what James Atlas was talking about in his comment on my second book, this is in my third book, the terminal flatness and greyness of American life, United States life, and the attempts to alleviate this barrenness by all sorts of temporizing accommodations, going to Howard Johnson's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5919997] on a Sunday, or having a kinky party in New York [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60] to show off one's new paintings or celebrating the death of a genuine antique American and New Englander and looking at the house that he lived in and so on. Anyway the tune is called, the poem is called \"Mouth Organ Tunes\", and I use the mouth organ as an instrument here to suggest the, well the mouth organ is something that can be played in a band, but is better not, it's a very solitary instrument and to me it always conveys the loneliness of an individual against insurmountable odds. The poem is called \"Mouth Organ Tunes: The American Lost-and-Found\" and the first section is called, as promised, \"In a Ho-Jo's by the River\".\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:04:20\nReads \"Mouth Organ Tunes: The American Lost-and-Found, part 1: In a Ho-Jo's by the River\" from Pursuit of Honor. \n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:10:02\nLet me contrast that with a poem about Middle America in the best sense. The old Middle America of people who knew their own way and found their own way in the land, and lost their own way in recent years because of encroachments on the land. The poem is called \"The Big Rock Candy Mountain\" and it's dedicated to the memory of my half-brother, Winfield Shannon, itinerant farm worker, 1909-1969. And it has an epigraph by Basil Bunting [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2886803] which goes \"a mason times his mallet to a lark's twitter, \u2018til the stone spells the name, naming none, a man abolished\".\n\nL.E. Sissman\n00:11:04\nReads \"The Big Rock Candy Mountain\",  parts 1-5 [from Pursuit of Honor].\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:21:25\nLet me change to a slightly lighter vein, and read a poem that is a joke, essentially. It's called \"The Birdman of Cambridge, Mass.\" It's about a man I once roomed with in college, who was an Audobonophile, or whatever the word is, a bird nut and has since become a bird expert. Anyway, this is how the poem goes, it's called \"The Birdman of Cambridge, Mass.\".\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:22:05\nReads \"The Birdman of Cambridge, Mass.\" [from Dying: An Introduction].\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:22:55\nThat is also a description I should say, of the Least Bittern. This is another poem about being in college...good lord, twenty seven years ago, I can't believe this, 1945, yeah that is damn near twenty seven years ago. It's called \"A College Room, Lowell R-34\", a building at Harvard [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q13371], 1945.\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:23:26\nReads \"A College Room, Lowell R-34, 1945\" [from Dying: An Introduction].\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:25:12\nAnd there's a footnote to this poem, dedicated to the maid, good lord, this is a long time ago, we had maids in those rooms. It was a very capable lady named Mrs. Circassian. And it's called \"Footnote, Mrs. Circassian\".\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:25:28\nReads \"Footnote, Mrs. Circassian\" [from Dying: An Introduction].\n\nAudience\n00:26:07\nLaughter.\n\nL.E. Sissman\n00:26:10\nThank you, she was a very nice lady, and deserved a much less ironic tribute than that, she was a home away from home herself. Let's see now, I've got all sorts of possible choices here. Why don't I read a poem about a shattering experience I had which I think maybe all of you may have had at one time or another, going back to a place where you had lived as a kid, and finding how puny it was and how destroyed it was by the passage of time. This is a poem about a place in Detroit where I had lived in the 30's and went back to in 1964 when the poem was written. It's called \"East Congress and McDougall Streets, Detroit, May 25\".\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:27:03\nReads \"East Congress and McDougall Streets, Detroit, May 25\" [from Dying: An Introduction].\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:29:30\nAnd finally, one more poem from this rue, if I can find it, called \"The Museum of Comparative Zoology\" and it is about indeed falling in love with an old beat up museum of Comparative Zoology, and finding one's place in the philia.\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:29:56\nReads \"The Museum of Comparative Zoology\" [from Dying: An Introduction].\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:32:19\nLet me get onto a poem that is now again a little bit more serious, although not ultimately so, I hope. It's about being very sick at the hospital and knowing one is in good hands. It's called \"A Deathplace\".\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:32:41\nReads \"A Death Place\" [from Scattered Returns].\n \nUnknown\n00:35:27\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n\nL.E. Sissman\n00:35:28\nReads \u201cSmall Space\u201d [from Scattered Returns].\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:36:12\nNot entirely and seriously...I think this might be time to call a five minute break during which I will smoke a cigarette and get my wind back and then we will proceed. Ok? \n[Audience applause]. Thank you. I won't take all this junk off, if I do I'll be in serious trouble.\n\nUnknown\n00:36:46\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:36:48\nThis is a poem about the same thing the last poem was about, called \"Getting On\", and I'll read only one part of it since that's all I've written so far. It's called \"Grave Expectations\".\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:37:04\nReads \"Getting On: Grave Expectations\" [published later in Hello, Darkness: The Collected Poems of L.E. Sissman].\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:39:15\nAnd this is a poem that is sort of mysterious and I'm not sure that I understand it either but I'll read it, called, if I can find the end of it, yeah. \"On Meeting No One in New York\". This is about doing a very daring thing in middle age, not taking a girl up on it. \"On Meeting No One in New York\".\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:39:45\nReads \"The Mid-Forties: On Meeting No One in New York\" [published later in Hello, Darkness: The Collected Poems of L.E. Sissman].\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:41:46\nAnd finally, not finally, there are two more I think. One is a true story, the other is a dream, but they are both nice to end on April 7th, even though there still may be snow on the ground, with a note of spring. This really happened to a friend of mine in Berlin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q64] in 1945 in April, and it's called \"A Comedy in Ruins\".\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:42:24\nReads \"A Comedy in Ruins\" [published later in Hello, Darkness: The Collected Poems of L.E. Sissman].\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:45:39\nAnd finally, an all nice sweet, pleasant poem, except for the passage of time which none of us can do anything about, based on a dream. It's called \"Cockaigne: A Dream\".\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:45:56\nReads \"Cockaigne: A Dream\" [published later in Hello, Darkness: The Collected Poems of L.E. Sissman].\n\nL.E. Sissman\n00:50:38\nThank you.\n\nAudience\n00:50:39\nApplause [cut off].\n\nEND\n00:50:52\n"

At the age of thirteen, Sissman won the National Spelling Bee in Washington and was aired on national radio as a Quiz Kid. He entered Harvard at the young age of sixteen in 1944. In 1946, however, he was dismissed, got a job as a stack boy in the Boston Public Library, and began writing poetry. Sissman and a few of his classmates founded a literary magazine, Halcyon, which only ran for two issues, but nevertheless received contributions from e.e. cummings and Wallace Stevens. Sissman was readmitted to Harvard in 1948 and received Harvard\u2019s Garrison Poetry Prize. He graduated cum laude in 1949, elected class poet. He then moved to New York and worked as a copy editor, until returning to Boston in 1952. By this time, he had stopped writing poetry. Sissman worked as an aide to John F. Kennedy\u2019s first Senate campaign as well as various smaller jobs. In 1956 he was hired as a copywriter for the advertising firm of Kenyon and Eckhardt. By 1969, he was the vice president and creative director of the same firm. In 1963, he started to write poetry again. Sissman was diagnosed with the then-incurable Hodgkin\u2019s disease in 1965, encouraging him to write more and more verse. He was awarded the Guggenheim fellowship in 1968, a grant from the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1969. Sissman published his first book of poetry in 1968, Dying: An Introduction (Little, Brown and Company), and Pursuit of Honor in 1971 (Little, Brown and Company). He began writing reviews for the New Yorker, and in 1975 Innocent Bystander: The Scene from the 70\u2019s was published (Vanguard Press). L.E. Sissman wrote up until his death in 1976. His unpublished poems were collected with previously published poems in Hello, Darkness: The Collected Poems of L.E. Sissman (Little, Brown and Company) in 1978.\n"

                "contents": "Stanton Hoffman\n00:00:00\nL.E. Sissman's three books of poems are Dying: An Introduction, Scattered Returns and Pursuit of Honor. The poet James Atlas made the following observation about Scattered Returns that it \"engages a voice so casual, so tuneless that the depression which pervades each page is in danger of being overlooked. Not the shrill agony of despair, but the flat surfaces of the unfulfilled or what characterizes his diction\". But also I'd like to take a line from a Sissman poem out of context, \"evidently, even desperation leads a charmed life\". Ladies and gentleman, L.E. Sissman.\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:00:45\nThank you. Well let me begin by refuting one of those statements that Stanley just made, Stanton, I'm sorry, just made. I was not a singing vacuum cleaner salesman, that was a canard that was incorporated into my vita by my publisher, who misread a biographical note I wrote. I once worked for a vacuum cleaner company that made its salesmen sing pep songs before they went out to tackle the ladies in the neighbourhood, so we'd get up in the morning and sing all these ridiculous songs and then go out and try to sell vacuum cleaners but the two were not really related, it was just hyping oneself up for the gritty day of trying to sell these poor ladies on a vacuum cleaner. Now I've seen you've kindly reproduced, and incidentally you've been most kind here in Montreal, I've been received royally, more so than any place I've been lately to read poetry and I greatly appreciated, I feel it's kind of a homecoming since my mother is a Canadian, from Ontario [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1904], not Quebec [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q176], but I've been in Montreal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q34] many times before and I'm very fond of this city and if I finally lose patience with the U. S. and A. [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30] as Walt Kelly [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q933892] says in Pogo [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2100584] I'll migrate up here, I feel it an eminently sensible thing to do. So it's nice to have a pleasant reception here. And since you've kindly reproduced one of the poems from a group called \"Mouth Organ Tunes: the American Lost-and-Found\" on your mimeographed sheet, I thought I'd start off by reading that poem. I'm going to say a few words at the risk of being dull about what each one of these poems I'm going to read is for, what I meant it to mean. This particular one is talking about the well, kind of what James Atlas was talking about in his comment on my second book, this is in my third book, the terminal flatness and greyness of American life, United States life, and the attempts to alleviate this barrenness by all sorts of temporizing accommodations, going to Howard Johnson's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5919997] on a Sunday, or having a kinky party in New York [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60] to show off one's new paintings or celebrating the death of a genuine antique American and New Englander and looking at the house that he lived in and so on. Anyway the tune is called, the poem is called \"Mouth Organ Tunes\", and I use the mouth organ as an instrument here to suggest the, well the mouth organ is something that can be played in a band, but is better not, it's a very solitary instrument and to me it always conveys the loneliness of an individual against insurmountable odds. The poem is called \"Mouth Organ Tunes: The American Lost-and-Found\" and the first section is called, as promised, \"In a Ho-Jo's by the River\".\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:04:20\nReads \"Mouth Organ Tunes: The American Lost-and-Found, part 1: In a Ho-Jo's by the River\" from Pursuit of Honor. \n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:10:02\nLet me contrast that with a poem about Middle America in the best sense. The old Middle America of people who knew their own way and found their own way in the land, and lost their own way in recent years because of encroachments on the land. The poem is called \"The Big Rock Candy Mountain\" and it's dedicated to the memory of my half-brother, Winfield Shannon, itinerant farm worker, 1909-1969. And it has an epigraph by Basil Bunting [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2886803] which goes \"a mason times his mallet to a lark's twitter, \u2018til the stone spells the name, naming none, a man abolished\".\n\nL.E. Sissman\n00:11:04\nReads \"The Big Rock Candy Mountain\",  parts 1-5 [from Pursuit of Honor].\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:21:25\nLet me change to a slightly lighter vein, and read a poem that is a joke, essentially. It's called \"The Birdman of Cambridge, Mass.\" It's about a man I once roomed with in college, who was an Audobonophile, or whatever the word is, a bird nut and has since become a bird expert. Anyway, this is how the poem goes, it's called \"The Birdman of Cambridge, Mass.\".\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:22:05\nReads \"The Birdman of Cambridge, Mass.\" [from Dying: An Introduction].\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:22:55\nThat is also a description I should say, of the Least Bittern. This is another poem about being in college...good lord, twenty seven years ago, I can't believe this, 1945, yeah that is damn near twenty seven years ago. It's called \"A College Room, Lowell R-34\", a building at Harvard [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q13371], 1945.\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:23:26\nReads \"A College Room, Lowell R-34, 1945\" [from Dying: An Introduction].\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:25:12\nAnd there's a footnote to this poem, dedicated to the maid, good lord, this is a long time ago, we had maids in those rooms. It was a very capable lady named Mrs. Circassian. And it's called \"Footnote, Mrs. Circassian\".\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:25:28\nReads \"Footnote, Mrs. Circassian\" [from Dying: An Introduction].\n\nAudience\n00:26:07\nLaughter.\n\nL.E. Sissman\n00:26:10\nThank you, she was a very nice lady, and deserved a much less ironic tribute than that, she was a home away from home herself. Let's see now, I've got all sorts of possible choices here. Why don't I read a poem about a shattering experience I had which I think maybe all of you may have had at one time or another, going back to a place where you had lived as a kid, and finding how puny it was and how destroyed it was by the passage of time. This is a poem about a place in Detroit where I had lived in the 30's and went back to in 1964 when the poem was written. It's called \"East Congress and McDougall Streets, Detroit, May 25\".\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:27:03\nReads \"East Congress and McDougall Streets, Detroit, May 25\" [from Dying: An Introduction].\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:29:30\nAnd finally, one more poem from this rue, if I can find it, called \"The Museum of Comparative Zoology\" and it is about indeed falling in love with an old beat up museum of Comparative Zoology, and finding one's place in the philia.\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:29:56\nReads \"The Museum of Comparative Zoology\" [from Dying: An Introduction].\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:32:19\nLet me get onto a poem that is now again a little bit more serious, although not ultimately so, I hope. It's about being very sick at the hospital and knowing one is in good hands. It's called \"A Deathplace\".\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:32:41\nReads \"A Death Place\" [from Scattered Returns].\n \nUnknown\n00:35:27\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n\nL.E. Sissman\n00:35:28\nReads \u201cSmall Space\u201d [from Scattered Returns].\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:36:12\nNot entirely and seriously...I think this might be time to call a five minute break during which I will smoke a cigarette and get my wind back and then we will proceed. Ok? \n[Audience applause]. Thank you. I won't take all this junk off, if I do I'll be in serious trouble.\n\nUnknown\n00:36:46\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:36:48\nThis is a poem about the same thing the last poem was about, called \"Getting On\", and I'll read only one part of it since that's all I've written so far. It's called \"Grave Expectations\".\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:37:04\nReads \"Getting On: Grave Expectations\" [published later in Hello, Darkness: The Collected Poems of L.E. Sissman].\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:39:15\nAnd this is a poem that is sort of mysterious and I'm not sure that I understand it either but I'll read it, called, if I can find the end of it, yeah. \"On Meeting No One in New York\". This is about doing a very daring thing in middle age, not taking a girl up on it. \"On Meeting No One in New York\".\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:39:45\nReads \"The Mid-Forties: On Meeting No One in New York\" [published later in Hello, Darkness: The Collected Poems of L.E. Sissman].\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:41:46\nAnd finally, not finally, there are two more I think. One is a true story, the other is a dream, but they are both nice to end on April 7th, even though there still may be snow on the ground, with a note of spring. This really happened to a friend of mine in Berlin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q64] in 1945 in April, and it's called \"A Comedy in Ruins\".\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:42:24\nReads \"A Comedy in Ruins\" [published later in Hello, Darkness: The Collected Poems of L.E. Sissman].\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:45:39\nAnd finally, an all nice sweet, pleasant poem, except for the passage of time which none of us can do anything about, based on a dream. It's called \"Cockaigne: A Dream\".\n \nL.E. Sissman\n00:45:56\nReads \"Cockaigne: A Dream\" [published later in Hello, Darkness: The Collected Poems of L.E. Sissman].\n\nL.E. Sissman\n00:50:38\nThank you.\n\nAudience\n00:50:39\nApplause [cut off].\n\nEND\n00:50:52\n",

His early connections with the Black Mountain Poets and the relationships he made with Canadian poets from Vancouver across Canada to Montreal have been essential because he bridged the gap of distance and made new types of poetry available to young poets. Montrealer Louis Dudek wrote that Bowering\u2019s \u201cmost important contribution to the new generation of Montreal poets was the institution of a series of readings at Sir George [Williams University] which exposed them to the diverse experimentation that was taking place across Canada and the U.S.\u201d",

[Audience laughter]. I said I liked it Al. [Audience laughter]. I'm related to practically everybody here. I'll turn this off now. [Audience laughter].\n \nIntroducer\n00:04:12\n...I think that George Bowering  [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1239280] has read or done\u2014 or not done, or not written. On the back of [that book (?)], it says that he has two new books, one called Curious from Coach House Press [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5137585], and another In the Flesh, coming out with McClelland and Stewart [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6800322]. The one thing I can add to that is\u2014 has to do with baseball [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5369], about which I know much less than George. You still have your team?\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:04:51\nYes.\n \nIntroducer\n00:04:54\nOkay, it's occurred to me that George understands one thing that is rather important to understand that is that the difference between stepping up to the plate and hitting the ball out of the park, and going [unintelligible], on the one hand, and on the other, stepping up to the plate and being there when the bat does what it's supposed to do and the ball takes itself out of the park. And this applies to baseball, and it also applies to poems. And that's what George understands.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:05:48\nFor those that live in California [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q99], that's what Suzuki Roshi [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q572599] calls Zen Baseball. I'm really excited to be back here, this is really a burn for me, because, can you hear me if I talk at this level? I'm hearing an echo, but I\u2014 can you hear me? [Audience laughter]. I'm reading for the next three weeks back and forth but this is the first one so I haven't got stale with any of this stuff yet in the east. And I'm going to come back in a few minutes to Autobiology, because I've never read it in the east although I started writing it in Montreal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q340] and finished it in Vancouver [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q24639], but before I do I'm going to read a piece that is sort of representative of what I've been doing lately in Vancouver, called \"Desert Elm\", the desert being the Okanagan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1812222] in this instance and the elm being the kind of tree that people planted there that wasn't there before and grew\u2014 they tried a lot of other ones and they didn't work. And it's a poem about my father and it deals with\u2014 it was begun with his heart attack he had in August and what happened after that, to me.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:07:22\nReads \"Desert Elm\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:20:04\nThat's the longest one I'll read I think. I was going to go into Autobiology, but I'm just going to jump right now into one section of Curious, I'm going to read the Jack Spicer [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3805658] part for Artie [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4800979], and then I'll [unintelligible] Curious is a-\u2014that's one of the books that's coming out this week, it's about, it's a book about poets, sort of, and this one's about Jack Spicer, who, Artie digs.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:20:43\nReads \"Jack Spicer\" from Curious.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:22:10\nHe was supposed to be moving\u2014 that was in the summer of '65, he was up in Vancouver and just decided to move up there so he wouldn't die, and because he would die if he stayed in San Francisco [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q62], and then he said, well just before that I'll go down to the San Francisco Poetry Festival, and when that's over in three weeks I'll come up to Vancouver, and he died during the second week. Okay, this is\u2014 Autobiology is a book  that came out, two years ago this month, actually, 72, yeah. And I started writing it in Westmount [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q139497] as they say and finished it in Kitsilano [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4179275]. I started writing it in an expensive flat in Westmount, and finished it in a commune on the edge of the water in Vancouver and it's a story about, as it suggests, it's a story, it's a book, it's poetry, it's prose, it's something about things that have changed me in terms of my head but first in terms of chemicals and physiologically, changed my body literally and so on. So I'll just, I'll read portions of it. I toyed with the idea of reading the whole book, it's the sort of thing we do in Vancouver, like we sit down and read the whole book, and this was published the same day as Stan Persky's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2330087] The Day, a book called The Day, and it's the same length, about a hundred pages, and he read The Day and we took a break, and I read Autobiology and then we took a break of a couple of hours and he read The Day again. But that's sort of\u2014 that happens a little\u2014 it's a little easier to take when everybody is kind of a volunteer anyway, when everybody in the audience has known all the time that this was being written and that it was going to be read, the whole book. So I'll just read parts of it so you get a taste of it. Each section is about one and a quarter foolscap pages when it's handwritten, long, approximately so it turns out to be about two of these pages. \"Chapter One\"\u2014 there's forty-eight chapters. \"Chapter One: The Raspberries\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:24:41 \nReads \"Chapter One: The Raspberries\" from Autobiology.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:26:06 \nDid that ever happen to--I'm sure these kinds of things must have happened to--the way I was telling [unintelligible] this afternoon that the way this book is written was I knew the general frame was things that changed me that way, from things put in my body, generally, or pieces of my body taken off, or whatever. Or pieces of my body going out into someone else's body or whatever. And I'd go home in my house in Westmount, from here, and I'd say 'I got it! Today I'm going to do the broken tool part' and I'd run home and I'd start controlling the thing and I'd throw it away, so all the pieces that are in here are the pieces that are not thrown away, the ones where I didn't know what I was going to write when I started writing. I have the sense that I tried to describe that afternoon as being simply equal to what was coming in the story. This is \"Chapter 2\", I'll read \"Chapter 1\" and 2 and 3 and 4 and then I'll skip. This is \"The Teeter Totter\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:27:05\nReads \"Chapter 2: The Teeter Totter\" from Autobiology.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:28:22\nReads \"Chapter 3: The Pollywogs\" from Autobiology.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:29:31\n\"The Flying Dream\". This is the origin of why I decided to write poetry I think, or at least I've always made that connection. \"The Flying Dream\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:29:40\nReads \"Chapter 4: The Flying Dream\" from Autobiology.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:30:54\nIt's the basis of that West Coast [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1974] elitism, Al. I\u2014 after I'd done this whole book I found out there's two chapters called \"The Breaks\", I'd totally forgotten that this chapter had written me this time. So this is the first chapter on \u201cThe Breaks\u201d.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:31:15\nReads \"Chapter 8: The Breaks\" from Autobiology [audience laughter throughout].\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:32:34\nGee, there's one I've never read before, I mean, out loud [audience laughter]. I'm not going to anyway, heck with it. Oh, here's one that every once in a while there's, it comes to, the thing comes to writing itself or talking about the writing of itself, so here's one called \"Composition\", for those that are worried about the problem it'll be totally clear. I think. It defines composition. \"Composition\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:33:02\nReads \"Chapter 14: Composition\" from Autobiology.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:34:32\nHere's the other one called \"The Breaks\".\n \nGeorge Bowering \n00:34:35.49\nReads \"Chapter 20: The Breaks\" from Autobiology.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:35:53\nReads [\u201cChapter 21: Come\u2019 from Autobiology].\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:37:13\nThis is one that, this is a favourite amongst the [serifs (?)] in Vancouver. The\u2014 I live in a community now as different from the community I lived in a couple of years ago of all https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5882404], Esalen [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5882404], encounters all the time and they're always talking about shrinkage and they're always telling me why don't you take shrinkage, and I say 'I don't feel like I need shrinkage' and they said 'that proves you need shrinkage'. Can't get out of it, you know, that's your problem\u2014 you don't think you need... So this one is sort of a reply to that, it's called \"The Childhood\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:37:56\nReads \"Chapter 26: The Childhood\" from Autobiology.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:39:05\nThis one's about the literary world, it's called \"St. Louis\", where, St. Louis is where William Burroughs [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q38022] and an earlier poet came from. T.S. Sandburn [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q37767], I think his name was. [audience laughter.]\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:39:21\nReads \"Chapter 27: St. Louis\" from Autobiology.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:40:49\nThen there's a whole series of pieces on towns that I lived in which I'll skip over. Skip that one, skip that one, get to these ones at the end. Here's one called \"The Flesh\", which I guess was involved with at the time, writing a book of poems about the flesh.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:41:23\nReads \"Chapter 43: The Flesh\" from Autobiology.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:42:43\nI think I'll read the last couple in this one, and then see what time it is. \"The Operations\" everybody is my chance, right? Every vessel, living in a house with my mother talking about operations the last couple of weeks and she couldn't really do it. So I get my chance now, \u2018cause I don't really get the chance\u2014 that's my mother on the cover of the book by the way, that's my mother and that's me. There she is.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:43:14\nReads \"Chapter 45: The Operations\" from Autobiology.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:44:53\nAnd the last two, this is \"The Scars\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:44:56\nReads \"Chapter 47: The Scars\" from Autobiology.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:46:24\nAnd the last one is called naturally, \"The Body\", Chapter 48.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:46:32\nReads \"Chapter 48: The Body\" from Autobiology.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:47:48\nThat was Autobiology, it's actually, can you imagine, a tetralogy. And the first volume was called Geneve and it was based on a found thing with the tarot pack [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q583269] and with the Geneva version of the French pack, Marseilles pack. The second one was Autobiology and the third one was Curious and the fourth one is\u2014 Dwight Gardiner wrote it, in a book called the Book of the Occasional. I was going to write it but he wrote it, so I didn't have to. It's just absolutely beautiful and if you see a Book of the Occasional, you'll see what I mean. It's just a gorgeous, gorgeous book. Oh, gee, I'd love to read\u2014 how long can I have now?\n \nUnknown\n00:48:45\n[Cut or edit made in tape].\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:48:46\n...Because I just suddenly remembered I'd love to read a piece I have called The Big Leagues. But then I also have a book called At War with the U.S. that I\u2014 was the first book of poems I've written in years, but maybe I'll just read The Big Leagues, that will probably take\u2014 and then maybe I'll read one or two pieces from Curious. This is a book\u2014a thing called The Big Leagues and it's in a few- in five sections and maybe I'll get tired before I get to the fifth one, but I'll just see how\u2014 the first one is called \"The Detroit Tigers\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q650855].\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:49:21\nReads \"The Detroit Tigers\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:51:57\nThat was written in South Slocan, B.C. [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q18379776] I think this is my favourite one, it's called \"The Dallas Cowboys\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q204862].\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:52:09\nReads \"The Dallas Cowboys\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:54:57\nThe next one's called \"The San Diego Padres\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q721134] but I'm going to skip that one because it's about getting dope [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60168] into\u2014 what happens is that Chance is coming back, he's now wearing the uniform that Slim Chance had before he died, a U.S. Army uniform that says \"Chance\" on it and \"U.S. Army\" and they're sneaking some dope into San Diego and it has to do with some Padres whose clothes are taken off so they can use them to hide the dope and everything. The next one's called \"The Buffalo Sabres\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q131206].\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:55:32\nBegins reading \"The Buffalo Sabres\". \n\nGeorge Bowering\n00:55:37\nOh, by the way what happens is that I took four quotations from poetry, and three of them are taken from the normal Ohio academic American Poetry Anthology and one of them is taken from Robert Creeley [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q918620] at the end, and you can tell. I can't even remember what poets I took from, like all those guys sorta have the same thing, you know, Donald Hall [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q976924] Anthology Poets if you know what I mean.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:56:05\nResumes reading \"The Buffalo Sabres\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:59:06\nAnd this one is for a lot of friends of mine, it's called \"The Minnesota Twins\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q604879] and he's going on, he's leaving Buffalo [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q40435] and going to\u2014 has anyone here been to\u2014 has anyone here been to Bemidji, Minnesota [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q730430]? You know what they got there right? That great big, blue Ox and the great big Paul Bunyan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7149597] carved about 30 feet high or something like that. And other than that, it's a beautiful town, you know, it has the\u2014 it looks like the underground of another town turn upside-down, so the bottom is up above the ground, right? \"The Minnesota Twins\".\n \nAnnotation\n00:59:39\nReads \"The Minnesota Twins\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n01:02:26\nI think I'll read like for ten minutes and that'll be for a total of an hour, five minutes or something like that. I'll just, I'll pick, this is Curious, which is a\u2014 that other book's coming out, it's called In the Flesh and it's maybe the last book of occasional, magazine book verse poetry I ever do. It deals with the experience of being in your 30s and finding out that the world isn't round after all and how sad you can be and how strong emotions can be. It has an introduction called \"I Never Felt Such Love\". But it's mainly lyric poetry, and I just, I've read so much of that that it's got to be too easy to read and write and everything. So I'll read a few of these. The poets who are mentioned in Curious, it happens that there are a lot of my friends who aren't in the book. Because, again, I wrote it that way, if you know, if that person did not come up, excuse me, from the other side of the page or however that feeling is to be described, if the voice wasn't there or something, for instance I really wanted to do a Roy Kiyooka [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3445789] poem, and you know, I just couldn't and it didn't come and I had wanted to but if I had tried that it just would have been screwed up. Some of these are American, some are Canadians, a couple are English and maybe one or two other things. And the first one is, naturally, Charles Olson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q922978]. Olson, as you probably know, was about 6 ft 10 and weighed about 300 pounds. And I first met him\u2014 I was standing at the bottom of a flight of stairs and he was coming down them. So I said 'hello' to the knees of his sear-sucker suit.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n01:04:19\nReads \"Charles Olson\" from Curious.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n01:05:57\nI'll get some Canadians in here. Margaret Atwood [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q183492], she's the first Canadian to appear in here.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n01:06:16\nReads \"Margaret Atwood\" from Curious.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n01:07:36\nThere are some poets in here that you won't know that are more specifically Vancouver-oriented poets perhaps that aren't as well known out here so I'll skip those. This is \"bp Nichol\". Everybody knows bpNichol [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4953105], or everybody is bpNichol.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n01:07:57\nReads \"bp Nichol\" from Curious.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n01:09:40\n\"Stephen Spender\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q448764]. I was going to skip this one, but it has a few moments in it.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n01:09:53\nReads \"Stephen Spender\" from Curious.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n01:11:18\nThat's, boy, that's\u2014 like you're out on the West Coast where you've never seen a poet before in your life and the first one they bring you is this guy you've been reading in books and he's a white-haired\u2014 it's unbelievable. You know, John Newlove's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6250356]? John Newlove, for those who know John Newlove.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n01:11:36\nReads \"John Newlove\" from Curious.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n01:13:08\nThat last part is from a title of one of his books. David McFadden [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5237344] is, this is the David McFadden piece and maybe I'll read it and a couple more. It's not my favourite but it's one that I like reading. David McFadden\u2014 well, it tells you what he's like, but David McFadden is a\u2014 he scared the hell out of Allen Ginsberg [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6711] because he writes really funny poems, like he literally has things, like he walks out into the backyard and sees the Archangel Gabriel [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q81989] or a space man and just talks to it and talks about it in the story of the poem a paragraph after he's talked about going out and buying some cigarettes or something like that and Ginsberg thought, wow, what a weird spaced out guy, so Victor Coleman [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q23882910] took him down to Hamilton [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q133116] to see David, David\u2014 he's got, as he said in the note of one of his books, \"I was born in 1940 and I comb my hair straight back\", and in his house, he's got an electric pendulum clock and you know that sort of thing.

I like the Lionel Kearns [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6555690] one actually...Oh I don't know what's happened to the Lionel Kearns one, it's one of my very favourites too. I think maybe, I'll see if I can find the Lionel one in a second then I'll read it and I'll finish off with the bill bissett [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4911496] one. If I just had the book with me it'd be a hell of a lot easier. I don't think I'm going to find the Kearns one. I can't find the Kearns one, it's all about how he can't find anything.

                "notes": "Poet, novelist, anthologist and critic George Bowering was born in Penticton, British Columbia in 1935. In 1954 he served in the Royal Canadian Air Force until 1957, when he pursued a Bachelor\u2019s degree in 1960 and a Master\u2019s degree in 1963 from the University of British Columbia. With fellow poets Frank Davey, David Dawson, James Reid, Fred Wah and critic Warren Tallman, he founded Tish in 1961, a poetry newsletter which had monumental reverberations across Canada. This magazine, influenced by styles of the Black Mountain Poets and of the East Coast poetry of Louis Dudek, Raymond Souster and Irving Layton, brought a \u201cnew wave\u201d of poetry to Canada. Bowering\u2019s first collection of poetry began with Sticks and Stones (Tishbooks, 1962) with a preface written by Robert Creeley, and was followed by Points on the grid (Contact Press, 1964) and Man in Yellow Boots (El Corno Emplumado, 1965). Bowering also founded the magazine Imago (1964-1974), which featured critical essays and poetry, and he also contributed to Open Letter as an editor. Bowering then moved eastwards, teaching at the University of Calgary from 1963-1966, enrolled in the Ph.D. program at the University of Western Ontario. A year later, Bowering accepted a position as the writer-in-residence in 1967 at Sir George Williams University (now Concordia University) in Montreal, becoming a lecturer in 1967-1971. Bowering joined the Sir George Williams University Poetry Reading Series Committee in the fall of 1967, which was being run by Roy Kiyooka, Stanton Hoffman and Howard Fink. In 1972 he left Montreal and began a long career teaching at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia. He has published over fifty books of poetry, prose, short stories, essays, reviews, plays as well as pieces that combine and defy genres. A selection of his publications are as follows: Gen\u00e8ve (Coach House Press, 1971), Autobiology (New Star Books, 1972), Curious (Coach House Press, 1973), In the Flesh (McClelland & Stewart, 1974), Allophanes (Coach House Press, 1976), Burning Water (Beaufort Books, 1980), Caprice (Penguin Books, 1988),  Harry\u2019s Fragments (Coach House Press, 1990), Rewriting my Grandfather (Nomados, 2005), Baseball Love (Talonbooks, 2006) and Shall I compare: July 2006 (George Bowering, 2008). Bowering published his interview with Black Mountain poet Robert Duncan: An Interview (Coach House Press, 1971), a book-length study on Canadian poet Al Purdy: Al Purdy (Copp Clark, 1970), along with editing several anthologies such as Vibrations: Poems from Youth (Cage, 1970), Fiction of Contemporary Canada (Coach House Press, 1980) and Likely Stories: A Postmodern Sampler (Coach House Press, 1992). Bowering has won two Governor General's Awards for poetry,  for Rocky Mountain Foot (McClelland & Stewart, 1968) and The Gangs Kosmos (House of Anansi, 1969), and one for fiction in 1980 for Burning Water (Beaufort Books, 1980). George Bowering continues teaching, inspiring and writing at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia."

And I'm going to come back in a few minutes to Autobiology, because I've never read it in the east although I started writing it in Montreal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q340] and finished it in Vancouver [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q24639], but before I do I'm going to read a piece that is sort of representative of what I've been doing lately in Vancouver, called \"Desert Elm\", the desert being the Okanagan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1812222] in this instance and the elm being the kind of tree that people planted there that wasn't there before and grew\u2014 they tried a lot of other ones and they didn't work. And it's a poem about my father and it deals with\u2014 it was begun with his heart attack he had in August and what happened after that, to me.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:07:22\nReads \"Desert Elm\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:20:04\nThat's the longest one I'll read I think. I was going to go into Autobiology, but I'm just going to jump right now into one section of Curious, I'm going to read the Jack Spicer [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3805658] part for Artie [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4800979], and then I'll [unintelligible] Curious is a-\u2014that's one of the books that's coming out this week, it's about, it's a book about poets, sort of, and this one's about Jack Spicer, who, Artie digs.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:20:43\nReads \"Jack Spicer\" from Curious.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:22:10\nHe was supposed to be moving\u2014 that was in the summer of '65, he was up in Vancouver and just decided to move up there so he wouldn't die, and because he would die if he stayed in San Francisco [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q62], and then he said, well just before that I'll go down to the San Francisco Poetry Festival, and when that's over in three weeks I'll come up to Vancouver, and he died during the second week. Okay, this is\u2014 Autobiology is a book  that came out, two years ago this month, actually, 72, yeah. And I started writing it in Westmount [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q139497] as they say and finished it in Kitsilano [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4179275]. I started writing it in an expensive flat in Westmount, and finished it in a commune on the edge of the water in Vancouver and it's a story about, as it suggests, it's a story, it's a book, it's poetry, it's prose, it's something about things that have changed me in terms of my head but first in terms of chemicals and physiologically, changed my body literally and so on. So I'll just, I'll read portions of it. I toyed with the idea of reading the whole book, it's the sort of thing we do in Vancouver, like we sit down and read the whole book, and this was published the same day as Stan Persky's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2330087] The Day, a book called The Day, and it's the same length, about a hundred pages, and he read The Day and we took a break, and I read Autobiology and then we took a break of a couple of hours and he read The Day again. But that's sort of\u2014 that happens a little\u2014 it's a little easier to take when everybody is kind of a volunteer anyway, when everybody in the audience has known all the time that this was being written and that it was going to be read, the whole book. So I'll just read parts of it so you get a taste of it. Each section is about one and a quarter foolscap pages when it's handwritten, long, approximately so it turns out to be about two of these pages. \"Chapter One\"\u2014 there's forty-eight chapters. \"Chapter One: The Raspberries\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:24:41 \nReads \"Chapter One: The Raspberries\" from Autobiology.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:26:06 \nDid that ever happen to--I'm sure these kinds of things must have happened to--the way I was telling [unintelligible] this afternoon that the way this book is written was I knew the general frame was things that changed me that way, from things put in my body, generally, or pieces of my body taken off, or whatever. Or pieces of my body going out into someone else's body or whatever. And I'd go home in my house in Westmount, from here, and I'd say 'I got it! Today I'm going to do the broken tool part' and I'd run home and I'd start controlling the thing and I'd throw it away, so all the pieces that are in here are the pieces that are not thrown away, the ones where I didn't know what I was going to write when I started writing. I have the sense that I tried to describe that afternoon as being simply equal to what was coming in the story. This is \"Chapter 2\", I'll read \"Chapter 1\" and 2 and 3 and 4 and then I'll skip. This is \"The Teeter Totter\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:27:05\nReads \"Chapter 2: The Teeter Totter\" from Autobiology.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:28:22\nReads \"Chapter 3: The Pollywogs\" from Autobiology.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:29:31\n\"The Flying Dream\". This is the origin of why I decided to write poetry I think, or at least I've always made that connection. \"The Flying Dream\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:29:40\nReads \"Chapter 4: The Flying Dream\" from Autobiology.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:30:54\nIt's the basis of that West Coast [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1974] elitism, Al. I\u2014 after I'd done this whole book I found out there's two chapters called \"The Breaks\", I'd totally forgotten that this chapter had written me this time. So this is the first chapter on \u201cThe Breaks\u201d.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:31:15\nReads \"Chapter 8: The Breaks\" from Autobiology [audience laughter throughout].\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:32:34\nGee, there's one I've never read before, I mean, out loud [audience laughter]. I'm not going to anyway, heck with it. Oh, here's one that every once in a while there's, it comes to, the thing comes to writing itself or talking about the writing of itself, so here's one called \"Composition\", for those that are worried about the problem it'll be totally clear. I think. It defines composition. \"Composition\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:33:02\nReads \"Chapter 14: Composition\" from Autobiology.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:34:32\nHere's the other one called \"The Breaks\".\n \nGeorge Bowering \n00:34:35.49\nReads \"Chapter 20: The Breaks\" from Autobiology.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:35:53\nReads [\u201cChapter 21: Come\u2019 from Autobiology].\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:37:13\nThis is one that, this is a favourite amongst the [serifs (?)] in Vancouver. The\u2014 I live in a community now as different from the community I lived in a couple of years ago of all https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5882404], Esalen [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5882404], encounters all the time and they're always talking about shrinkage and they're always telling me why don't you take shrinkage, and I say 'I don't feel like I need shrinkage' and they said 'that proves you need shrinkage'. Can't get out of it, you know, that's your problem\u2014 you don't think you need... So this one is sort of a reply to that, it's called \"The Childhood\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:37:56\nReads \"Chapter 26: The Childhood\" from Autobiology.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:39:05\nThis one's about the literary world, it's called \"St. Louis\", where, St. Louis is where William Burroughs [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q38022] and an earlier poet came from. T.S. Sandburn [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q37767], I think his name was. [audience laughter.]\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:39:21\nReads \"Chapter 27: St. Louis\" from Autobiology.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:40:49\nThen there's a whole series of pieces on towns that I lived in which I'll skip over. Skip that one, skip that one, get to these ones at the end. Here's one called \"The Flesh\", which I guess was involved with at the time, writing a book of poems about the flesh.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:41:23\nReads \"Chapter 43: The Flesh\" from Autobiology.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:42:43\nI think I'll read the last couple in this one, and then see what time it is. \"The Operations\" everybody is my chance, right? Every vessel, living in a house with my mother talking about operations the last couple of weeks and she couldn't really do it. So I get my chance now, \u2018cause I don't really get the chance\u2014 that's my mother on the cover of the book by the way, that's my mother and that's me. There she is.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:43:14\nReads \"Chapter 45: The Operations\" from Autobiology.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:44:53\nAnd the last two, this is \"The Scars\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:44:56\nReads \"Chapter 47: The Scars\" from Autobiology.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:46:24\nAnd the last one is called naturally, \"The Body\", Chapter 48.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:46:32\nReads \"Chapter 48: The Body\" from Autobiology.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:47:48\nThat was Autobiology, it's actually, can you imagine, a tetralogy. And the first volume was called Geneve and it was based on a found thing with the tarot pack [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q583269] and with the Geneva version of the French pack, Marseilles pack. The second one was Autobiology and the third one was Curious and the fourth one is\u2014 Dwight Gardiner wrote it, in a book called the Book of the Occasional. I was going to write it but he wrote it, so I didn't have to. It's just absolutely beautiful and if you see a Book of the Occasional, you'll see what I mean. It's just a gorgeous, gorgeous book. Oh, gee, I'd love to read\u2014 how long can I have now?\n \nUnknown\n00:48:45\n[Cut or edit made in tape].\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:48:46\n...Because I just suddenly remembered I'd love to read a piece I have called The Big Leagues. But then I also have a book called At War with the U.S. that I\u2014 was the first book of poems I've written in years, but maybe I'll just read The Big Leagues, that will probably take\u2014 and then maybe I'll read one or two pieces from Curious. This is a book\u2014a thing called The Big Leagues and it's in a few- in five sections and maybe I'll get tired before I get to the fifth one, but I'll just see how\u2014 the first one is called \"The Detroit Tigers\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q650855].\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:49:21\nReads \"The Detroit Tigers\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:51:57\nThat was written in South Slocan, B.C. [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q18379776] I think this is my favourite one, it's called \"The Dallas Cowboys\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q204862].\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:52:09\nReads \"The Dallas Cowboys\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:54:57\nThe next one's called \"The San Diego Padres\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q721134] but I'm going to skip that one because it's about getting dope [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60168] into\u2014 what happens is that Chance is coming back, he's now wearing the uniform that Slim Chance had before he died, a U.S. Army uniform that says \"Chance\" on it and \"U.S. Army\" and they're sneaking some dope into San Diego and it has to do with some Padres whose clothes are taken off so they can use them to hide the dope and everything. The next one's called \"The Buffalo Sabres\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q131206].\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:55:32\nBegins reading \"The Buffalo Sabres\". \n\nGeorge Bowering\n00:55:37\nOh, by the way what happens is that I took four quotations from poetry, and three of them are taken from the normal Ohio academic American Poetry Anthology and one of them is taken from Robert Creeley [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q918620] at the end, and you can tell. I can't even remember what poets I took from, like all those guys sorta have the same thing, you know, Donald Hall [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q976924] Anthology Poets if you know what I mean.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:56:05\nResumes reading \"The Buffalo Sabres\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:59:06\nAnd this one is for a lot of friends of mine, it's called \"The Minnesota Twins\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q604879] and he's going on, he's leaving Buffalo [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q40435] and going to\u2014 has anyone here been to\u2014 has anyone here been to Bemidji, Minnesota [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q730430]? You know what they got there right? That great big, blue Ox and the great big Paul Bunyan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7149597] carved about 30 feet high or something like that. And other than that, it's a beautiful town, you know, it has the\u2014 it looks like the underground of another town turn upside-down, so the bottom is up above the ground, right? \"The Minnesota Twins\".\n \nAnnotation\n00:59:39\nReads \"The Minnesota Twins\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n01:02:26\nI think I'll read like for ten minutes and that'll be for a total of an hour, five minutes or something like that. I'll just, I'll pick, this is Curious, which is a\u2014 that other book's coming out, it's called In the Flesh and it's maybe the last book of occasional, magazine book verse poetry I ever do. It deals with the experience of being in your 30s and finding out that the world isn't round after all and how sad you can be and how strong emotions can be. It has an introduction called \"I Never Felt Such Love\". But it's mainly lyric poetry, and I just, I've read so much of that that it's got to be too easy to read and write and everything. So I'll read a few of these. The poets who are mentioned in Curious, it happens that there are a lot of my friends who aren't in the book. Because, again, I wrote it that way, if you know, if that person did not come up, excuse me, from the other side of the page or however that feeling is to be described, if the voice wasn't there or something, for instance I really wanted to do a Roy Kiyooka [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3445789] poem, and you know, I just couldn't and it didn't come and I had wanted to but if I had tried that it just would have been screwed up. Some of these are American, some are Canadians, a couple are English and maybe one or two other things. And the first one is, naturally, Charles Olson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q922978]. Olson, as you probably know, was about 6 ft 10 and weighed about 300 pounds. And I first met him\u2014 I was standing at the bottom of a flight of stairs and he was coming down them. So I said 'hello' to the knees of his sear-sucker suit.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n01:04:19\nReads \"Charles Olson\" from Curious.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n01:05:57\nI'll get some Canadians in here. Margaret Atwood [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q183492], she's the first Canadian to appear in here.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n01:06:16\nReads \"Margaret Atwood\" from Curious.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n01:07:36\nThere are some poets in here that you won't know that are more specifically Vancouver-oriented poets perhaps that aren't as well known out here so I'll skip those. This is \"bp Nichol\". Everybody knows bpNichol [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4953105], or everybody is bpNichol.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n01:07:57\nReads \"bp Nichol\" from Curious.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n01:09:40\n\"Stephen Spender\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q448764]. I was going to skip this one, but it has a few moments in it.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n01:09:53\nReads \"Stephen Spender\" from Curious.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n01:11:18\nThat's, boy, that's\u2014 like you're out on the West Coast where you've never seen a poet before in your life and the first one they bring you is this guy you've been reading in books and he's a white-haired\u2014 it's unbelievable. You know, John Newlove's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6250356]? John Newlove, for those who know John Newlove.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n01:11:36\nReads \"John Newlove\" from Curious.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n01:13:08\nThat last part is from a title of one of his books. David McFadden [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5237344] is, this is the David McFadden piece and maybe I'll read it and a couple more. It's not my favourite but it's one that I like reading. David McFadden\u2014 well, it tells you what he's like, but David McFadden is a\u2014 he scared the hell out of Allen Ginsberg [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6711] because he writes really funny poems, like he literally has things, like he walks out into the backyard and sees the Archangel Gabriel [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q81989] or a space man and just talks to it and talks about it in the story of the poem a paragraph after he's talked about going out and buying some cigarettes or something like that and Ginsberg thought, wow, what a weird spaced out guy, so Victor Coleman [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q23882910] took him down to Hamilton [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q133116] to see David, David\u2014 he's got, as he said in the note of one of his books, \"I was born in 1940 and I comb my hair straight back\", and in his house, he's got an electric pendulum clock and you know that sort of thing. And Ginsberg took one look and said [inaudible \u2018scared\u2019 sound], and ran away. Just couldn't believe it, you know, it's unbelievable. So, David McFadden.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n01:14:30\nReads \"David McFadden\" from Curious.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n01:16:24\nThere wasn't a comma in there, that was the Indian food coming back. Now let's see\u2026\n\nAudience Member 1\n01:16:31\nAddresses George Bowering [unintelligible; requests poem].\n\nGeorge Bowering\n01:16:33\nNo, he didn't get in there either, and I'm very sad about that, just people that got in that I wish didn't get in and there's people that didn't get in that I wish did get in. \n\nAudience Member 2\n01:16:44\n[Unintelligible]...Raymond Souster [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q304129].\n\nGeorge Bowering\n01:16:46\nYeah, I think I might have skipped over Raymond Souster, the Raymond Souster one is, as you might imagine the shortest one in the book.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n01:16:58\nReads \"Raymond Souster\" from Curious.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n01:17:59\nI got a Purdy one too, but Al weighs 210 pounds. No, I've always made it a policy not to read the ones of somebody that's there. I don't know if there are any other ones that I'm going to read.\n\nAudience Member 3\n01:18:25\nAddresses George Bowering [unintelligible; requests poem].\n\nGeorge Bowering\n01:18:26\nYeah, I don't know where the hell it is. I like the Lionel Kearns [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6555690] one actually...Oh I don't know what's happened to the Lionel Kearns one, it's one of my very favourites too. I think maybe, I'll see if I can find the Lionel one in a second then I'll read it and I'll finish off with the bill bissett [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4911496] one. If I just had the book with me it'd be a hell of a lot easier. I don't think I'm going to find the Kearns one. I can't find the Kearns one, it's all about how he can't find anything. This is the bissett one and then I'll finish off with that.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n01:19:30\nReads bill bissett\" from Curious.\n\nGeorge Bowering\n01:21:16\nThank you.\n\nAudience\n01:21:17\nApplause. \n\nEND\n01:21:29\n",

It also consists of some SGWU Department of English records related to student academic activities in the 1940s and to public readings and lectures, and a few interviews, produced between 1966 and 1972. The fonds mainly includes minutes of departmental meetings and some course timetables. It also includes some student papers in bound volumes and 63 sound recordings (80 audio reels) mainly composed of poetry readings (see the Concordia SpokenWeb project which uses this material) but also a few lectures given at SGWU. There are also loose typed sheets describing some of the SGWU poetry readings.",

His early connections with the Black Mountain Poets and the relationships he made with Canadian poets from Vancouver across Canada to Montreal  have been essential because he bridged the gap of distance and made new types of poetry available to young poets. Montrealer Louis Dudek wrote that Bowering\u2019s \u201cmost important contribution to the new generation of Montreal poets was the institution of a series of readings at Sir George [Williams University] which exposed them to the diverse experimentation that was taking place across Canada and the U.S.\u201d[1] . Bowering has anthologized many Canadian poets, as well as publishing over fifty books of his own writing, establishing himself as an important figure in Canadian poetry. ",

The first poem I'll read is the one called \"Trail\" [feedback sounds].\n\nGeorge Bowering\n00:00:49\nReads \"Trail\" from Points on the Grid.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:01:36\n\"Locus Solus\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:01:40\nReads \"Locus Solus\" from Points on the Grid.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:02:42\nI might mention that the difference between this book and the other one is that more often you'll see on the page in this book that I've been working out certain ideas about poetics [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q835023], certain ideas about syntax [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q37437], ideas about how to get the page down on the poem, all the things the Tish poets [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2384384] were working out in the early 1960s. As an example, the poem, \"Walking Poem\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:03:14\nReads \"Walking Poem\" from Points on the Grid.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:04:22\nI might mention, according to our poetics, or according to my poetics in that poem you'll see things operating such as a rhyme between the word 'shadow' and the word 'bashful'. \"Family\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:04:39\nReads \"Family\" from Points on the Grid.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:05:33\nThe following is the poem that I think is the best in the book, and that I think most people whom I've talked to agree this is the best poem in the book. \"Grandfather\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:05:47\nReads \"Grandfather\" from Points on the Grid.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:07:25\n\"For A.\".\n \nAnnotation\n00:07:28\nReads \"For A.\" from Points on the Grid.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:07:49\nOne thing that separates Western Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1145847] from Eastern Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q795077] is the Spanish names of Western Canada and the Spaniards [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q160894] left their names all the way up the coast, not only in California and Oregon. This poem, set partly in Vancouver [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q24639] and partly on the rest of the B.C. coast is called \"Spanish B.C.\".\n\nGeorge Bowering\n00:08:11\nReads \"Spanish B.C\" from Points on the Grid.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:10:34\nI suppose I'd better read the title poem, \"Points on the Grid\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:10:42\nReads \"Points on the Grid\" from Points on the Grid.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:12:10\nI might mention, just for the record, that many of the things that I learned and tried to practice in that first book, I learned originally from poets such as Robert Duncan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q964391], Robert Creeley [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q918620], Charles Olson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q922978], all of whom visited Vancouver and helped the young poets in Vancouver out, very much, in learning about poetry. Now I plan to read from The Man in Yellow Boots, published this year, 1965, and in this book, I tend to move away from experimentation [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1384425], although I still retain many of the things that I tried to work out in the first book. In this book one of the things that I often do is turn to more social issues. First though, let me read the love poem that begins the book, this poem called \"To Cleave\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:13:14\nReads \"To Cleave\" from The Man in Yellow Boots.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:13:43\nThis book is a bilingual book, unfortunately not with French [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q150], but with Spanish [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1321] and just this once I'm going to see if I can read the Spanish version of the poem I just read. Spanish is called \"Penetrar\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:13:58\nReads \"Penetrar\" from The Man in Yellow Boots in Spanish.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:14:39\nIncidentally as a poetic note, some of that scratching and scrabbling noise in the background is my two small dogs beating each other up. This poem called \"Moon Shadow\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:14:54\nReads \"Moon Shadow\" from The Man in Yellow Boots.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:16:03\nThis then, is the other side of my poetry, this poem called \"Vox Crapulous\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:16:09\nReads \"Vox Crapulous\" from The Man in Yellow Boots.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:17:31\nFurther in that vein, this poem\u2019s written October 16, 1964: a momentous day. This poem is called \"The Day Before the Chinese A-Bomb\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:17:46.49\nReads \"The Day Before the Chinese A-Bomb\" from The Man in Yellow Boots.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:18:29\nThis a longer poem, I think one of the two best poems in the book the other one being \"The Descent\", this poem's called \"For WCW\"\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:18:39\nReads \"For WCW\" from The Man in Yellow Boots.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:21:16\nThis poem, written during our visit to Mexico [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q96] in 1964, called \"Esta Muy Caliente\" and the reason it's not called \"Hace Mucho Calor\" is because of something inherent in the Spanish language that those that know will understand.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:21:35\nReads \"Esta Muy Caliente\" from The Man in Yellow Boots.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:23:09\nI think the following is the best poem in this book, it's called \"The Descent\", the title taken from a William Carlos Williams [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q178106] poem of course.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:23:18.83\nReads \"The Descent\" from The Man in Yellow Boots.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:29:09\nAnd the last poem in the book, \"Breaking Up, Breaking Out\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:29:14\nReads \"Breaking Up, Breaking Out\" from The Man in Yellow Boots.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:30:03\nNow, some newer poems, while there's time. This newest one called \"The Oil\", written after a drive to Edmonton [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2096] and back from Calgary [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q36312].\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:30:14\nReads \"The Oil\" [published later in Rocky Mountain Foot: a lyric, a memoir].\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:32:03\nHere's a short poem called \"I Saw\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:32:07\nReads \"I Saw\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:32:20\nOkay, when I've just about come to the end of this side of the tape and I don't think I'll use the other side so that you can use it for somebody else, and once again I'm terribly sorry for being so late with this tape, and also if that does seem a loss, I'm sorry for not saying more things about poetry, I've been doing that less and less the further and further I've been getting away from Vancouver. So, Merry Christmas!\n \nEND\n00:32:58\n"

                "notes": "Poet, novelist, anthologist and critic George Bowering was born in Penticton, British Columbia in 1935. In 1954 he served in the Royal Canadian Air Force until 1957, when he pursued a Bachelor\u2019s degree in 1960 and a Master\u2019s degree in 1963 from the University of British Columbia. With fellow poets Frank Davey, David Dawson, James Reid, Fred Wah and critic Warren Tallman, he founded Tish in 1961, a poetry newsletter which had monumental reverberations across Canada. This magazine, influenced by styles of the Black Mountain Poets and of the East Coast poetry of Louis Dudek, Raymond Souster and Irving Layton, brought a \u201cnew wave\u201d of poetry to Canada. Bowering\u2019s first collection of poetry began with Sticks and Stones (Tishbooks, 1962) with a preface written by Robert Creeley, and was followed by Points on the Grid (Contact Press, 1964) and Man in Yellow Boots (El Corno Emplumado, 1965). Bowering also founded the magazine Imago (1964-1974), which featured critical essays and poetry, and he also contributed to Open Letter as an editor. Bowering then moved eastwards, teaching at the University of Calgary from 1963-1966, enrolled in the Ph.D. program at the University of Western Ontario. A year later, Bowering accepted a position as the writer-in-residence in 1967 at Sir George Williams University (now Concordia University) in Montreal, becoming a lecturer in 1967-1971. Bowering joined the Sir George Williams University Poetry Reading Series Committee in the fall of 1967, which was being run by Roy Kiyooka, Stanton Hoffman and Howard Fink. In 1972 he left Montreal and began a long career teaching at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia. He has published over fifty books of poetry, prose, short stories, essays, reviews, plays as well as pieces that combine and defy genres. A selection of his publications are as follows: Gen\u00e8ve (Coach House Press, 1971), Autobiology (New Star Books, 1972), Curious (Coach House Press, 1973), In the Flesh (McClelland & Stewart, 1974), Allophanes (Coach House Press, 1976), Burning Water (Beaufort Books, 1980), Caprice (Penguin Books, 1988), Harry\u2019s Fragments (Coach House Press, 1990), Rewriting my Grandfather (Nomados, 2005), Baseball Love (Talonbooks, 2006) and Shall I Compare: July 2006 (George Bowering, 2008). Bowering published his interview with Black Mountain poet Robert Duncan: An Interview, (Coach House Press, 1971), a book-length study on Canadian poet Al Purdy: Al Purdy (Copp Clark, 1970) along with editing several anthologies such as Vibrations: Poems from Youth (Cage, 1970), Fiction of Contemporary Canada (Coach House Press, 1980) and Likely Stories: A Postmodern Sampler (Coach House Oress, 1992). Bowering has won two Governor General Awards, for poetry in 1969 for Rocky Mountain Foot (McClelland & Stewart, 1968) and The Gangs Kosmos (Anasi, 1969); one for fiction in 1980 for Burning Water (Beaufort Books, 1980). George Bowering continues teaching, inspiring and writing at the Simon Fraser University in British Columbia."

As an example, the poem, \"Walking Poem\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:03:14\nReads \"Walking Poem\" from Points on the Grid.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:04:22\nI might mention, according to our poetics, or according to my poetics in that poem you'll see things operating such as a rhyme between the word 'shadow' and the word 'bashful'. \"Family\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:04:39\nReads \"Family\" from Points on the Grid.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:05:33\nThe following is the poem that I think is the best in the book, and that I think most people whom I've talked to agree this is the best poem in the book. \"Grandfather\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:05:47\nReads \"Grandfather\" from Points on the Grid.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:07:25\n\"For A.\".\n \nAnnotation\n00:07:28\nReads \"For A.\" from Points on the Grid.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:07:49\nOne thing that separates Western Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1145847] from Eastern Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q795077] is the Spanish names of Western Canada and the Spaniards [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q160894] left their names all the way up the coast, not only in California and Oregon. This poem, set partly in Vancouver [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q24639] and partly on the rest of the B.C. coast is called \"Spanish B.C.\".\n\nGeorge Bowering\n00:08:11\nReads \"Spanish B.C\" from Points on the Grid.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:10:34\nI suppose I'd better read the title poem, \"Points on the Grid\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:10:42\nReads \"Points on the Grid\" from Points on the Grid.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:12:10\nI might mention, just for the record, that many of the things that I learned and tried to practice in that first book, I learned originally from poets such as Robert Duncan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q964391], Robert Creeley [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q918620], Charles Olson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q922978], all of whom visited Vancouver and helped the young poets in Vancouver out, very much, in learning about poetry. Now I plan to read from The Man in Yellow Boots, published this year, 1965, and in this book, I tend to move away from experimentation [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1384425], although I still retain many of the things that I tried to work out in the first book. In this book one of the things that I often do is turn to more social issues. First though, let me read the love poem that begins the book, this poem called \"To Cleave\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:13:14\nReads \"To Cleave\" from The Man in Yellow Boots.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:13:43\nThis book is a bilingual book, unfortunately not with French [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q150], but with Spanish [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1321] and just this once I'm going to see if I can read the Spanish version of the poem I just read. Spanish is called \"Penetrar\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:13:58\nReads \"Penetrar\" from The Man in Yellow Boots in Spanish.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:14:39\nIncidentally as a poetic note, some of that scratching and scrabbling noise in the background is my two small dogs beating each other up. This poem called \"Moon Shadow\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:14:54\nReads \"Moon Shadow\" from The Man in Yellow Boots.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:16:03\nThis then, is the other side of my poetry, this poem called \"Vox Crapulous\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:16:09\nReads \"Vox Crapulous\" from The Man in Yellow Boots.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:17:31\nFurther in that vein, this poem\u2019s written October 16, 1964: a momentous day. This poem is called \"The Day Before the Chinese A-Bomb\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:17:46.49\nReads \"The Day Before the Chinese A-Bomb\" from The Man in Yellow Boots.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:18:29\nThis a longer poem, I think one of the two best poems in the book the other one being \"The Descent\", this poem's called \"For WCW\"\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:18:39\nReads \"For WCW\" from The Man in Yellow Boots.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:21:16\nThis poem, written during our visit to Mexico [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q96] in 1964, called \"Esta Muy Caliente\" and the reason it's not called \"Hace Mucho Calor\" is because of something inherent in the Spanish language that those that know will understand.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:21:35\nReads \"Esta Muy Caliente\" from The Man in Yellow Boots.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:23:09\nI think the following is the best poem in this book, it's called \"The Descent\", the title taken from a William Carlos Williams [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q178106] poem of course.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:23:18.83\nReads \"The Descent\" from The Man in Yellow Boots.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:29:09\nAnd the last poem in the book, \"Breaking Up, Breaking Out\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:29:14\nReads \"Breaking Up, Breaking Out\" from The Man in Yellow Boots.\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:30:03\nNow, some newer poems, while there's time. This newest one called \"The Oil\", written after a drive to Edmonton [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2096] and back from Calgary [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q36312].\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:30:14\nReads \"The Oil\" [published later in Rocky Mountain Foot: a lyric, a memoir].\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:32:03\nHere's a short poem called \"I Saw\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:32:07\nReads \"I Saw\".\n \nGeorge Bowering\n00:32:20\nOkay, when I've just about come to the end of this side of the tape and I don't think I'll use the other side so that you can use it for somebody else, and once again I'm terribly sorry for being so late with this tape, and also if that does seem a loss, I'm sorry for not saying more things about poetry, I've been doing that less and less the further and further I've been getting away from Vancouver. So, Merry Christmas!\n \nEND\n00:32:58\n",

I have a very strong classical streak in me, I think, I like poems that are very regular, and poems that rhyme, and poems that are passionately intellectual, and I think that I feel this way because the poems that are the most passionately intellectual have a way of spilling over into something which is completely free in its feeling. Oh here's a little poem by Ben Jonson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q193857]. It's called \"On My First Sonne\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7091055]. A little elegy. \n \nJames Wright\n00:00:52\nReads \"On My First Sonne\" by Ben Jonson.\n \nJames Wright\n00:01:55\nPoor old Ben Jonson, in a pig's eye. The next poem I would like to say is by an American poet, W.S. Merwin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q680368], who has just published his selected translations, and of course in addition to the very beautiful poems of his own that Merwin has, he's been a prolific translator, and he, he really does know the languages. I've loved his poetry always because he has such a beautiful ear, it was very interesting to me when I saw him in New York [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60] a few weeks ago, when he said that his Selected Translations were about to appear. I asked him if he remembered the transla--well of course he remembered, I just told him I always liked very much the poem he had translated, a later poem by Garcia Lorca [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q41408]called \"Gacela of Unforseen Love\". What a weird thing! He didn't remember that he had done it. And it's not in his book. Well, I wish it were. \"Gacela of Unforseen Love\".\n \nJames Wright\n00:03:35\nReads \"Gacela of Unforseen Love\" by Federico Garcia Lorca and translated in English by W.S. Mervin.\n \nJames Wright\n00:04:30\nCan't imagine doing that in English and then forgetting that you've done it. Maybe it was frightening. Here in Montreal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q340] I've been thinking about what in the United States [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30] we hear about Montreal, about the English background, and the French background, and the Canadian, all of which are very vital and alive, but what do you make of the Irish up here? Are there any Irishmen in Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16]? [pauses for response]. Just on March 17th. Only on March 17th, fine. My own family background is kind of complicated. I'm an Ohioan, which is a kind of hell in itself [audience laughter]. But both sides of my family have roots in the south, but they have a strong streak of Irish behind them; it wasn't until I was quite old that I found out about some of Irish literature, of course we've all of us read Yeats [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q40213]. The son of a bitch. He not only did everything first but he did it best. We all feel that. But really he didn't do it all first. He may have done it best but there are some Irish things that I found that perhaps he grew out of it. Do you know for example, the poems of, of all people, Jonathan Swift [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q41166]? Jonathan Swift is a wonderful poet. He published Gulliver's Travels [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q181488] in 1725, and I found a little poem of his called \"On Burning a Dull Poem\". Of 1729. And it has a, it's a wonderful expression of the Irish art of the curse. I shouldn't lean on this. I don't mean the poem, I mean the lectern. [Audience laughter]. But it's a wonderful example of the Irish art of the curse, what is supposed to be very regular and it's almost like a prayer. The art here is that you should decide first of all whether or not what you feel annoyed by really is worthy of a curse. And then if it is, you should not come out and blast it directly, but exercise some indirection on it. So here we have Swift, \"On Burning a Dull Poem\".\n \nJames Wright\n00:07:29\nReads  \"On Burning a Dull Poem\" by Jonathan Swift.\n \nJames Wright\n00:08:25\nI can't help bringing that a little closer to our own time. We all know the very beautiful plays of John Millington Synge [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q213447]. Perhaps people haven't so widely enjoyed his poems. He didn't write a great many, but to my mind he wrote enough. He also, he made a translation of Petrarch [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1401] into the same language as those people, as those women on the Aran Islands [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q212893] who used to clean his room. He said he learned something about the rhythm of his language just by listening to them. So that in the sound of the Petrarch after Laura is dead and is appearing in heaven, and the angels are astonished by her beauty, the sestet of that sonnet, in Synge's translation, the angels see Laura and suddenly say, \"What rare beauty is that now? What rare beauty at all.\" So that those old women who cleaned his room on the Aran Islands have the voices of the angels. Well, after The Playboy of the Western World [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q451517] was first produced, he was criticized and he wanted to write something about the criticism. He didn't know whether the, who the critic was, really, he didn't know anything about him, he didn't know whether or not the critic had a sister. But there was the poem, and since he realized, as Aristotle [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q868] said, that \u201cpoetry is a higher and more philosophical thing than history\u201d--history being limited to what is or was, and poetry having available to it what ought to be, what might be...Synge invented a sister, and he wrote a little poem called \"Upon the Sister of the Critic who Attacked the Playboy\". [Audience laughter]. This is a prayer. [Audience laughter]. And blasphemy also is a very delicate art. \"Lord\"...no I have to say, that you have to understand, really what \"Mountjoy\" is. Mountjoy is a place on the edge of Dublin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1761], a kind of charity place where the Skid Rowers go.  \n \nJames Wright\n00:11:06\nReads \"Upon the Sister of the Critic who Attacked the Playboy\" by John Millington Synge.\n \nAudience\n00:11:32\nLaughter.\n \nJames Wright\n00:11:43\nI came to like those Irish poets, so much, because they enjoyed poetry. My God, you've got to do something, life is a mess. Well, alright, I want to say one more poem that I care about. I know I'm going on too long with this business. One more. Let me say it in English first, and you can't say that I'm translating at sight, but perhaps by ear, and it'll be very awkward, but it's not awkward in the German. When--it's a poem that doesn't have a title. I don't think I'll tell you who wrote it. The poem goes: \"When the clocks nearby strike as if their own hearts were beating, and things--that is, material objects-things, with hesitant voices say to me softly, \u2018Are you there?\u2019 Then I am not the same man who woke this morning, for the night has sent me a name which no one to whom I spoke by daylight can listen to without being deeply frightened. Every door in me opens, and then I know that nothing dies, neither gesture, nor prayer. Things are too heavy for that. My whole childhood stands always around me. I am never alone. Many who live before me, and many who spring forth from me\u201d--which I would also, I suppose, translate as \u2018many who spring forth out of my body'--\u201dwove, wove into my being. And if I sit down opposite you and say, lightly, I have been suffering, do you hear? Who knows? Who murmurs that voice with me?\"\n\nJames Wright\n00:14:19\nReads untitled poem by Rainer Maria Rilke in German.\n \nJames Wright\n00:15:28\nOh, no that's corny, of course it's by Rilke [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q76483]. I mean it's corny to hold back the name. It's one of those lyrics that Rilke wrote between those New Poems [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7011009] and the big terrible ones, the Duino Elegies [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q688426] and the Sonnets. Well, let me proceed now to some poems of my own. The first one I think I will read is a poem called \"A Note left in Jimmy Leonard's Shack\". I've been thinking about that poem a little bit recently for a lot of reasons. I think I should tell you something about what's behind it. There was an old guy called Minnegan Leonard who, or maybe Francis Leonard, who grew up--no, [laughter] I mean he was old, I grew up--he was already there [audience laughter]. Back in Martins Ferry [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1018313], Ohio [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1397]. The story about him was that he had been a very well-educated man and he sort of deteriorated, everyone said. One night, a couple of friends and I found him in the, when the snow was starting to fall. And his, he wore a pair of overalls, the ones that cross behind, and they were too big, my friends and I helped him get home. We were very much afraid of his brother, Jimmy. Minnegan had drunk so much that his brain was practically gone, and he had nothing left to say to the universe except \"God bless my soul.\" We were stupid, we were afraid of his brother Jimmy, because his brother Jimmy, although drunk, was still mean. He still had some of his humanity left. And we were afraid of him. I thought about this poem as being spoken by a boy, I was about twelve years old. I also wanted to see if I could get away with swearing in a poem, and give the word, give the profanity some of its true force. The only thing that I deplore about the open use of profanity is that very soon, when the four-letter words are used commonly, they start to lose touch with their old, magical, dark force. When I was in the army, twenty years ago, I realized that this happened. You couldn't say \"fuck\" to refer to anything dark or anything interesting. It became a musical notation. Merely a musical notation, like a comma, when you were having chow. [Audience laughter]. But then there came those necessary moments when one absolutely needs to curse, and what does one do then? Then I saw all sorts of people around me, floundering, turning to what Wordsworth would have called the \"poetic diction,\" and finding that to say \"fuck\" had about as much effect on the release of one's feelings as the Finney crew had on anybody who was trying to read about fish in the end of the 18th century. Then I met a poetic genius named Mark W. Patrick from Crafton, Alabama [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q173], who was not hobbled by this. Someone asked him once, no he had invention, true invention. He knew how to swear. My wife has heard this before. Alright, I'll say it again. Someone said to him, \"Where are you from?\" And he said, \"I come from so far back in the country, they have to fan the coon-farts out of the kitchen to keep from making.\u201d [Audience laughter]. No, wait a minute, you didn't hear the rest of the conceit. Now listen to this carefully and think of it as in Shakespearian. \"I come from so far back in the country they have to fan the coon-farts out of the kitchen to keep from making ring-tailed biscuits.\" [Audience laughter]. I thought, let us somehow rescue through invention our power to curse. Well this poem is called, \"A Note Left in Jimmy Leonard's Shack\". It's about taking Minnegan Leonard home when he was helpless in the snow.\n \nJames Wright\n00:21:07\nReads \"A Note Left in Jimmy Leonard's Shack\" [from Saint Judas].\n \nUnknown\n00:22:43\nAmbient Sound. \n \nJames Wright\n00:22:58\nNow for a while I think I would like to read from my new book. There are a couple of city poems in this new book, well, more than a couple, and many of the things that I had written before were about the country, more or less, in Ohio, and in Minnesota [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1527]. But I developed a certain feeling about cities, I guess, and...I didn't have a very happy time in Minneapolis [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q36091] and St. Paul [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q28848], but I lived there for about eight years, and before I left I thought I ought to say farewell, somehow. I couldn't think of a title for this poem that would convey or suggest what I really felt, and the true title came to me. I wanted it to be a poem about, not only about Minneapolis but about many American cities, and what has been happening in them. Minneapolis is my favourite because I lived there for quite a while, and they had a very big Skid Row there, and the Skid Row was cleared out by the city administration, the last, the most recent one. It was a very big Skid Row, between the Great Northern Railroad Station and the Mississippi River [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1497], right a strip across there, several blocks wide. And they sort of flattened it. They put up an insurance building and the rest were parking lots. And it never occurred to them that the people who lived there would...well, even existed. And I know where those people went, they went down Nickolet Avenue, scattered down there. It's a very strange thing. Spiro T. Agnew [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q203433], our new American Vice-President said, during the campaign, \"The reasons the slums are so over-crowded is that there are too many people in them.\" [Audience laughter]. Well, this is my city poem. It's called \"The Minneapolis Poem\".\n \nJames Wright\n00:26:11\nReads \"The Minneapolis Poem\" [from Shall We Gather at the River].\n \nJames Wright\n00:30:39\nThe next poem is called, \"In Terror of Hospital\"-- [cut or edit in tape] \"In Terror of Hospital Bills\".\n \nJames Wright\n00:30:51\nReads \"In Terror of Hospital Bills\" [from Shall We Gather at the River].   \n \nJames Wright\n00:32:36\nThis poem is called \"The Poor Washed Up by Chicago Winter\". It's about leaving Chicago [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1297]. I went down there for a long Thanksgiving weekend to visit a man whose poetry I had seen, I had never met him, I admired it very much. His name is Bill Mott. He has finally published a first book. He lived in an area down there where there were some sort of poor people...I don't mean poor people in the sense of being savagely poor, really really put down, but just sort of drifters, the guys who go into the, who go in on Thanksgiving and get a dinner there from the Salvation Army [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q188307] and look at it and then sweep up and leave. \n \nJames Wright\n00:33:53\nReads \"The Poor Washed Up by Chicago Winter\" [from Shall We Gather at the River].\n \nJames Wright\n00:35:43\nYou know, George Orwell [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3335] remarked in Down and Out in Paris and London [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1355487] that when he got back to London [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q84] from France [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q142] where he'd been a dishwasher, he had so little money that he realized that he would have to beg, only somehow his clothes, ratty as they were, were still too good to beg with. And so he, he sold what clothes he had, or traded them, rather, for a really crummy suit of clothes, and when he got those old, really poor man's clothes on, he noticed all sorts of strange things. The way people looked at him. The way women looked at him. As well as other men. And the fact that he was poor had an effect on the way people's souls were shaped, somehow. I only had a very slight experience of that in my life, and I don't want any more of it. Because it's not very romantic. For a while I had a sort of, an account at a department store in Minneapolis, and I was behind in my payments. At that time I had an old green coat my father had given me, it didn't quite fit but a coat is a coat. So I had it, and I was, in order to keep myself going one way or another, I went up to the cashier's office at this department store and tried to cash a small cheque for twenty dollars, or something like that. There was a very beautiful girl there, the cashier, and she looked at me, and she disappeared for a moment and she came back with a fellow who had a crew cut. And he evidently was the Grand Vizier, or something. Well, they were about a foot and a half away from my face while I waited, and they talked about me, without paying any attention to me. And I realized something I had never realized before. That I'm, I am content simply to think about it, I don't want it to happen to me again  I thought, Jesus Christ, there are millions of people in this country who are treated like things, every single intimate moment of their lives. And it's not pretty. Well. \"Before a Cashier's Window in a Department Store\". The poem is in different parts and I think I'll indicate the numbers. \n \nJames Wright\n00:38:45\nReads \"Before a Cashier's Window in a Department Store\", Part 1 [from Shall We Gather at the River].\n \nJames Wright\n00:39:17\nReads \"Before a Cashier's Window in a Department Store\", Part 2 [from Shall We Gather at the River].\n \nJames Wright\n00:39:44\nReads \"Before a Cashier's Window in a Department Store\", Part 3 [from Shall We Gather at the River].\n \nJames Wright\n00:40:20\nReads \"Before a Cashier's Window in a Department Store\u201d, Part 4 [from Shall We Gather at the River].\n \nJames Wright\n00:40:38\nReads \"Before a Cashier's Window in a Department Store\", Part 5 [from Shall We Gather at the River].\n \nJames Wright\n00:41:11\nI think that I'll read a couple of nature poems. Nature, in poetry and song. One of the parts of the United States that I like very much...I came to like, I've spoken kind of harshly about Minneapolis, and I have harsh feelings about that city, but actually I love the West, out at the edge of Minnesota, you have, there's Minnesota, North Dakota [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1207], and South Dakota [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1211], and that part of the country there is sort of the, it's not really flat, it's a little rolling, but it's the beginning of the prairie, and the prairie is a beautiful thing. I spent a summer up around Fargo [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q34109], North Dakota, and I like Fargo, I like to walk there in the summer evenings, I would go even out to the other end of town, and, well it really is a real city, there are about eighty-thousand people, but you could walk out to the edge of town, and just a little beyond the town the prairie would begin. There is something about that sudden opening that I like.  his is called, \"Outside Fargo, North Dakota\".\n \nJames Wright\n00:42:45\nReads \"Outside Fargo, North Dakota\" [from Shall We Gather at the River].\n \nJames Wright\n00:43:07\nNo, may I start the poem again, I miss, I made a mistake. \n \nJames Wright\n00:43:11\nReads \"Outside Fargo, North Dakota\u201d [from Shall We Gather at the River].\n \nJames Wright\n00:44:04\nNow this one is called \"A Poem Written under an Archway in a Discontinued Railway Station, Fargo, North Dakota\". I love those old trains, we were talking about this earlier, there's a certain thing about trains, especially in the West, west of Chicago. It's not true in the East. One of these days somebody's going to get a train from New York to Connecticut [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q779] or something and that train will never return, it'll keep coming back, every forty years with ghosts on it, flying Dutchmen. But it's different in the West, and...there's a discontinued railroad station. \n \nJames Wright\n00:44:53\nReads \"A Poem Written under an Archway in a Discontinued Railway Station, Fargo, North Dakota\" [from Shall We Gather at the River].\n \nJames Wright\n00:46:30\nI think I'll read...I think I'll read just a few more very short poems, perhaps two or three, and they're kind of nature poems, I guess. Nature indeed, one of them is a love poem. This is called \"A Light in the Hallway\". \n \nJames Wright\n00:47:07\nReads \"A Light in the Hallway\" [published as \u201cThe Lights in the Hallway\u201d in Shall We Gather at the River]. \n \nJames Wright\n00:48:06\nAnd then a couple out of my previous book. This poem is called \"Mary Bly\", it's for my goddaughter, and I stood up there in the church and they said, well, I went through the ceremony and I am her godfather, Mary Bly, it's the first child of my old friend, my old friends, Robert and Carol Bly. I feel very proud of this poem, but it's one of those times that, it signifies one of those times in my life when I really thought of something nice to do and did it. So many things I want to do that would be nice, and usually they turn out to be something either asinine or too late, or something. But I wrote this poem for little Mary's christening, and I had it, it's the only time I've ever done this, I had it specially printed on very nice paper and print and had it put in a little silver frame, and gave it to her mother, on the day of the christening. What a calm thing to pull on an audience, how can you help but like it. [Audience laughter]. If you don't like it, it means you don't like motherhood or small children, no. \"Mary Bly\".\n \nJames Wright\n00:49:51\nReads \"Mary Bly\" [from The Branch Will Not Break].\n\nJames Wright\n00:50:42\nAnd I think I will conclude with a poem which is just a description. There were some other descriptive poems in my last book which, for some weird reason, drove some reviewers to distraction. For example, in one poem, there was a poem about being at a bus stop at a place in Ohio and looking out the window and seeing a farmer at the beginning of a rain calling his cows in, and one reviewer got terribly upset about this and said, how...he's only stopping there on the bus, how did he know that there were a hundred black and white Holsteins. [Audience laughter]. And Robert Bly urged me and urged me to send the reviewer a postcard. I never did it, I wish I had. It was to have said, \"I counted the tits and divided by four.\" [Audience laughter]. Well, no but, just, I just want to present this poem. It's called \"A Blessing\", and for what it is, it's just a description of something. \n \nJames Wright\n00:52:28\nReads \"A Blessing\" [from The Branch Will Not Break].\n \nJames Wright\n00:54:02\nThank you. \n \nAudience\n00:54:03\nApplause. \n \nIntroducer\n00:54:21\nI'd just like to express all our thanks to James Wright [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6145850] for sharing his poetry and his curses and blessings with us tonight, and to remind you that the next reading in the series is by Muriel Rukeyser [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q735177] on Friday, January 24th. \n \nEND\n00:54:38\n"

                "notes": "American poet James Arlington Wright was born on December 13, 1927 in Martins Ferry, Ohio, an industrial town along the Ohio River. He began writing sonnets as a young child, was encouraged by his teachers to continue writing, though he suffered from a nervous breakdown in 1943. After graduation in 1946, Wright joined the U.S. Army, serving in Japan until 1948 when he returned to Ohio and enrolled in Kenyon College (where the influential John Crowe Ransom was teaching). His poetry was published in the Kenyon Review, Poetry (Chicago) and in The New Yorker.  In 1952 he married a high school classmate Liberty Kardules and spent the next year on a Fulbright Fellowship at the University of Vienna. His first child, Franz, was born in 1953, and Wright enrolled in graduate studies at the University of Washington in Seattle, where his teachers were Theodore Roethke and Stanley Kunitz. His first book, The Green Wall (Yale University Press, 1958) was published because of his submission to the Yale Series of Younger Poets competition, which W.H. Auden was judging. His second book, published in 1959 was Saint Judas (Wesleyan University Press), the same year he completed his Ph.D. dissertation on Charles Dickens. During the next few years, Wright\u2019s marriage failed, and he was denied tenure at the University of Minnesota. Wright\u2019s next publication, The Branch Will Not Break (Wesleyan University Press, 1963) proved to be groundbreaking, and was followed by Shall We Gather at the River (1968). Wright spent a few years at the Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota and was then awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1965-66. Wright moved again, to New York City and took up a position at Hunter College in 1966. He met his second wife, Edith Anne Runk that same year. Wright was awarded both a Rockefeller Foundation Grant and an Ingram Merrill Foundation award for the publication of Shall We Gather at the River (Wesleyan University) in 1969. Wright was able to publish his Collected Poems (Wesleyan University, 1971) which won a Pulitzer Prize and a Fellowship of the Academy of American Poets, and was followed by Two Citizens (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1973) and To a Blossoming Pear Tree (Farrer, Straus and Giroux, 1977). Wright was diagnosed with cancer of the tongue, and died four months later, in New York City on March 25, 1980. This Journey (Random House, 1982), Collected Prose (University of Michigan Press, 1983) and Above the River: The Complete Poems (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1992) were all published posthumously."

                "contents": "James Wright\n00:00:00\nWell, I feel about poetry in a curious way, I guess. I have a very strong classical streak in me, I think, I like poems that are very regular, and poems that rhyme, and poems that are passionately intellectual, and I think that I feel this way because the poems that are the most passionately intellectual have a way of spilling over into something which is completely free in its feeling. Oh here's a little poem by Ben Jonson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q193857]. It's called \"On My First Sonne\" [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7091055]. A little elegy. \n \nJames Wright\n00:00:52\nReads \"On My First Sonne\" by Ben Jonson.\n \nJames Wright\n00:01:55\nPoor old Ben Jonson, in a pig's eye. The next poem I would like to say is by an American poet, W.S. Merwin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q680368], who has just published his selected translations, and of course in addition to the very beautiful poems of his own that Merwin has, he's been a prolific translator, and he, he really does know the languages. I've loved his poetry always because he has such a beautiful ear, it was very interesting to me when I saw him in New York [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q60] a few weeks ago, when he said that his Selected Translations were about to appear. I asked him if he remembered the transla--well of course he remembered, I just told him I always liked very much the poem he had translated, a later poem by Garcia Lorca [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q41408]called \"Gacela of Unforseen Love\". What a weird thing! He didn't remember that he had done it. And it's not in his book. Well, I wish it were. \"Gacela of Unforseen Love\".\n \nJames Wright\n00:03:35\nReads \"Gacela of Unforseen Love\" by Federico Garcia Lorca and translated in English by W.S. Mervin.\n \nJames Wright\n00:04:30\nCan't imagine doing that in English and then forgetting that you've done it. Maybe it was frightening. Here in Montreal [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q340] I've been thinking about what in the United States [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30] we hear about Montreal, about the English background, and the French background, and the Canadian, all of which are very vital and alive, but what do you make of the Irish up here? Are there any Irishmen in Canada [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q16]? [pauses for response]. Just on March 17th. Only on March 17th, fine. My own family background is kind of complicated. I'm an Ohioan, which is a kind of hell in itself [audience laughter]. But both sides of my family have roots in the south, but they have a strong streak of Irish behind them; it wasn't until I was quite old that I found out about some of Irish literature, of course we've all of us read Yeats [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q40213]. The son of a bitch. He not only did everything first but he did it best. We all feel that. But really he didn't do it all first. He may have done it best but there are some Irish things that I found that perhaps he grew out of it. Do you know for example, the poems of, of all people, Jonathan Swift [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q41166]? Jonathan Swift is a wonderful poet. He published Gulliver's Travels [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q181488] in 1725, and I found a little poem of his called \"On Burning a Dull Poem\". Of 1729. And it has a, it's a wonderful expression of the Irish art of the curse. I shouldn't lean on this. I don't mean the poem, I mean the lectern. [Audience laughter]. But it's a wonderful example of the Irish art of the curse, what is supposed to be very regular and it's almost like a prayer. The art here is that you should decide first of all whether or not what you feel annoyed by really is worthy of a curse. And then if it is, you should not come out and blast it directly, but exercise some indirection on it. So here we have Swift, \"On Burning a Dull Poem\".\n \nJames Wright\n00:07:29\nReads  \"On Burning a Dull Poem\" by Jonathan Swift.\n \nJames Wright\n00:08:25\nI can't help bringing that a little closer to our own time. We all know the very beautiful plays of John Millington Synge [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q213447]. Perhaps people haven't so widely enjoyed his poems. He didn't write a great many, but to my mind he wrote enough. He also, he made a translation of Petrarch [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1401] into the same language as those people, as those women on the Aran Islands [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q212893] who used to clean his room. He said he learned something about the rhythm of his language just by listening to them. So that in the sound of the Petrarch after Laura is dead and is appearing in heaven, and the angels are astonished by her beauty, the sestet of that sonnet, in Synge's translation, the angels see Laura and suddenly say, \"What rare beauty is that now? What rare beauty at all.\" So that those old women who cleaned his room on the Aran Islands have the voices of the angels. Well, after The Playboy of the Western World [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q451517] was first produced, he was criticized and he wanted to write something about the criticism. He didn't know whether the, who the critic was, really, he didn't know anything about him, he didn't know whether or not the critic had a sister. But there was the poem, and since he realized, as Aristotle [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q868] said, that \u201cpoetry is a higher and more philosophical thing than history\u201d--history being limited to what is or was, and poetry having available to it what ought to be, what might be...Synge invented a sister, and he wrote a little poem called \"Upon the Sister of the Critic who Attacked the Playboy\". [Audience laughter]. This is a prayer. [Audience laughter]. And blasphemy also is a very delicate art. \"Lord\"...no I have to say, that you have to understand, really what \"Mountjoy\" is. Mountjoy is a place on the edge of Dublin [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1761], a kind of charity place where the Skid Rowers go.  \n \nJames Wright\n00:11:06\nReads \"Upon the Sister of the Critic who Attacked the Playboy\" by John Millington Synge.\n \nAudience\n00:11:32\nLaughter.\n \nJames Wright\n00:11:43\nI came to like those Irish poets, so much, because they enjoyed poetry. My God, you've got to do something, life is a mess. Well, alright, I want to say one more poem that I care about. I know I'm going on too long with this business. One more. Let me say it in English first, and you can't say that I'm translating at sight, but perhaps by ear, and it'll be very awkward, but it's not awkward in the German. When--it's a poem that doesn't have a title. I don't think I'll tell you who wrote it. The poem goes: \"When the clocks nearby strike as if their own hearts were beating, and things--that is, material objects-things, with hesitant voices say to me softly, \u2018Are you there?\u2019 Then I am not the same man who woke this morning, for the night has sent me a name which no one to whom I spoke by daylight can listen to without being deeply frightened. Every door in me opens, and then I know that nothing dies, neither gesture, nor prayer. Things are too heavy for that. My whole childhood stands always around me. I am never alone. Many who live before me, and many who spring forth from me\u201d--which I would also, I suppose, translate as \u2018many who spring forth out of my body'--\u201dwove, wove into my being. And if I sit down opposite you and say, lightly, I have been suffering, do you hear? Who knows? Who murmurs that voice with me?\"\n\nJames Wright\n00:14:19\nReads untitled poem by Rainer Maria Rilke in German.\n \nJames Wright\n00:15:28\nOh, no that's corny, of course it's by Rilke [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q76483]. I mean it's corny to hold back the name. It's one of those lyrics that Rilke wrote between those New Poems [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7011009] and the big terrible ones, the Duino Elegies [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q688426] and the Sonnets. Well, let me proceed now to some poems of my own. The first one I think I will read is a poem called \"A Note left in Jimmy Leonard's Shack\". I've been thinking about that poem a little bit recently for a lot of reasons. I think I should tell you something about what's behind it. There was an old guy called Minnegan Leonard who, or maybe Francis Leonard, who grew up--no, [laughter] I mean he was old, I grew up--he was already there [audience laughter]. Back in Martins Ferry [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1018313], Ohio [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1397]. The story about him was that he had been a very well-educated man and he sort of deteriorated, everyone said. One night, a couple of friends and I found him in the, when the snow was starting to fall. And his, he wore a pair of overalls, the ones that cross behind, and they were too big, my friends and I helped him get home. We were very much afraid of his brother, Jimmy. Minnegan had drunk so much that his brain was practically gone, and he had nothing left to say to the universe except \"God bless my soul.\" We were stupid, we were afraid of his brother Jimmy, because his brother Jimmy, although drunk, was still mean. He still had some of his humanity left. And we were afraid of him. I thought about this poem as being spoken by a boy, I was about twelve years old. I also wanted to see if I could get away with swearing in a poem, and give the word, give the profanity some of its true force. The only thing that I deplore about the open use of profanity is that very soon, when the four-letter words are used commonly, they start to lose touch with their old, magical, dark force. When I was in the army, twenty years ago, I realized that this happened. You couldn't say \"fuck\" to refer to anything dark or anything interesting. It became a musical notation. Merely a musical notation, like a comma, when you were having chow. [Audience laughter]. But then there came those necessary moments when one absolutely needs to curse, and what does one do then? Then I saw all sorts of people around me, floundering, turning to what Wordsworth would have called the \"poetic diction,\" and finding that to say \"fuck\" had about as much effect on the release of one's feelings as the Finney crew had on anybody who was trying to read about fish in the end of the 18th century. Then I met a poetic genius named Mark W. Patrick from Crafton, Alabama [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q173], who was not hobbled by this. Someone asked him once, no he had invention, true invention. He knew how to swear. My wife has heard this before. Alright, I'll say it again. Someone said to him, \"Where are you from?\" And he said, \"I come from so far back in the country, they have to fan the coon-farts out of the kitchen to keep from making.\u201d [Audience laughter]. No, wait a minute, you didn't hear the rest of the conceit. Now listen to this carefully and think of it as in Shakespearian. \"I come from so far back in the country they have to fan the coon-farts out of the kitchen to keep from making ring-tailed biscuits.\" [Audience laughter]. I thought, let us somehow rescue through invention our power to curse. Well this poem is called, \"A Note Left in Jimmy Leonard's Shack\". It's about taking Minnegan Leonard home when he was helpless in the snow.\n \nJames Wright\n00:21:07\nReads \"A Note Left in Jimmy Leonard's Shack\" [from Saint Judas].\n \nUnknown\n00:22:43\nAmbient Sound. \n \nJames Wright\n00:22:58\nNow for a while I think I would like to read from my new book. There are a couple of city poems in this new book, well, more than a couple, and many of the things that I had written before were about the country, more or less, in Ohio, and in Minnesota [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1527]. But I developed a certain feeling about cities, I guess, and...I didn't have a very happy time in Minneapolis [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q36091] and St. Paul [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q28848], but I lived there for about eight years, and before I left I thought I ought to say farewell, somehow. I couldn't think of a title for this poem that would convey or suggest what I really felt, and the true title came to me. I wanted it to be a poem about, not only about Minneapolis but about many American cities, and what has been happening in them. Minneapolis is my favourite because I lived there for quite a while, and they had a very big Skid Row there, and the Skid Row was cleared out by the city administration, the last, the most recent one. It was a very big Skid Row, between the Great Northern Railroad Station and the Mississippi River [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1497], right a strip across there, several blocks wide. And they sort of flattened it. They put up an insurance building and the rest were parking lots. And it never occurred to them that the people who lived there would...well, even existed. And I know where those people went, they went down Nickolet Avenue, scattered down there. It's a very strange thing. Spiro T. Agnew [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q203433], our new American Vice-President said, during the campaign, \"The reasons the slums are so over-crowded is that there are too many people in them.\" [Audience laughter]. Well, this is my city poem. It's called \"The Minneapolis Poem\".\n \nJames Wright\n00:26:11\nReads \"The Minneapolis Poem\" [from Shall We Gather at the River].\n \nJames Wright\n00:30:39\nThe next poem is called, \"In Terror of Hospital\"-- [cut or edit in tape] \"In Terror of Hospital Bills\".\n \nJames Wright\n00:30:51\nReads \"In Terror of Hospital Bills\" [from Shall We Gather at the River].   \n \nJames Wright\n00:32:36\nThis poem is called \"The Poor Washed Up by Chicago Winter\". It's about leaving Chicago [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1297]. I went down there for a long Thanksgiving weekend to visit a man whose poetry I had seen, I had never met him, I admired it very much. His name is Bill Mott. He has finally published a first book. He lived in an area down there where there were some sort of poor people...I don't mean poor people in the sense of being savagely poor, really really put down, but just sort of drifters, the guys who go into the, who go in on Thanksgiving and get a dinner there from the Salvation Army [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q188307] and look at it and then sweep up and leave. \n \nJames Wright\n00:33:53\nReads \"The Poor Washed Up by Chicago Winter\" [from Shall We Gather at the River].\n \nJames Wright\n00:35:43\nYou know, George Orwell [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q3335] remarked in Down and Out in Paris and London [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1355487] that when he got back to London [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q84] from France [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q142] where he'd been a dishwasher, he had so little money that he realized that he would have to beg, only somehow his clothes, ratty as they were, were still too good to beg with. And so he, he sold what clothes he had, or traded them, rather, for a really crummy suit of clothes, and when he got those old, really poor man's clothes on, he noticed all sorts of strange things. The way people looked at him. The way women looked at him. As well as other men. And the fact that he was poor had an effect on the way people's souls were shaped, somehow. I only had a very slight experience of that in my life, and I don't want any more of it. Because it's not very romantic. For a while I had a sort of, an account at a department store in Minneapolis, and I was behind in my payments. At that time I had an old green coat my father had given me, it didn't quite fit but a coat is a coat. So I had it, and I was, in order to keep myself going one way or another, I went up to the cashier's office at this department store and tried to cash a small cheque for twenty dollars, or something like that. There was a very beautiful girl there, the cashier, and she looked at me, and she disappeared for a moment and she came back with a fellow who had a crew cut. And he evidently was the Grand Vizier, or something. Well, they were about a foot and a half away from my face while I waited, and they talked about me, without paying any attention to me. And I realized something I had never realized before. That I'm, I am content simply to think about it, I don't want it to happen to me again  I thought, Jesus Christ, there are millions of people in this country who are treated like things, every single intimate moment of their lives. And it's not pretty. Well. \"Before a Cashier's Window in a Department Store\". The poem is in different parts and I think I'll indicate the numbers. \n \nJames Wright\n00:38:45\nReads \"Before a Cashier's Window in a Department Store\", Part 1 [from Shall We Gather at the River].\n \nJames Wright\n00:39:17\nReads \"Before a Cashier's Window in a Department Store\", Part 2 [from Shall We Gather at the River].\n \nJames Wright\n00:39:44\nReads \"Before a Cashier's Window in a Department Store\", Part 3 [from Shall We Gather at the River].\n \nJames Wright\n00:40:20\nReads \"Before a Cashier's Window in a Department Store\u201d, Part 4 [from Shall We Gather at the River].\n \nJames Wright\n00:40:38\nReads \"Before a Cashier's Window in a Department Store\", Part 5 [from Shall We Gather at the River].\n \nJames Wright\n00:41:11\nI think that I'll read a couple of nature poems. Nature, in poetry and song. One of the parts of the United States that I like very much...I came to like, I've spoken kind of harshly about Minneapolis, and I have harsh feelings about that city, but actually I love the West, out at the edge of Minnesota, you have, there's Minnesota, North Dakota [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1207], and South Dakota [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1211], and that part of the country there is sort of the, it's not really flat, it's a little rolling, but it's the beginning of the prairie, and the prairie is a beautiful thing. I spent a summer up around Fargo [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q34109], North Dakota, and I like Fargo, I like to walk there in the summer evenings, I would go even out to the other end of town, and, well it really is a real city, there are about eighty-thousand people, but you could walk out to the edge of town, and just a little beyond the town the prairie would begin. There is something about that sudden opening that I like.  his is called, \"Outside Fargo, North Dakota\".\n \nJames Wright\n00:42:45\nReads \"Outside Fargo, North Dakota\" [from Shall We Gather at the River].\n \nJames Wright\n00:43:07\nNo, may I start the poem again, I miss, I made a mistake. \n \nJames Wright\n00:43:11\nReads \"Outside Fargo, North Dakota\u201d [from Shall We Gather at the River].\n \nJames Wright\n00:44:04\nNow this one is called \"A Poem Written under an Archway in a Discontinued Railway Station, Fargo, North Dakota\". I love those old trains, we were talking about this earlier, there's a certain thing about trains, especially in the West, west of Chicago. It's not true in the East. One of these days somebody's going to get a train from New York to Connecticut [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q779] or something and that train will never return, it'll keep coming back, every forty years with ghosts on it, flying Dutchmen. But it's different in the West, and...there's a discontinued railroad station. \n \nJames Wright\n00:44:53\nReads \"A Poem Written under an Archway in a Discontinued Railway Station, Fargo, North Dakota\" [from Shall We Gather at the River].\n \nJames Wright\n00:46:30\nI think I'll read...I think I'll read just a few more very short poems, perhaps two or three, and they're kind of nature poems, I guess. Nature indeed, one of them is a love poem. This is called \"A Light in the Hallway\". \n \nJames Wright\n00:47:07\nReads \"A Light in the Hallway\" [published as \u201cThe Lights in the Hallway\u201d in Shall We Gather at the River]. \n \nJames Wright\n00:48:06\nAnd then a couple out of my previous book. This poem is called \"Mary Bly\", it's for my goddaughter, and I stood up there in the church and they said, well, I went through the ceremony and I am her godfather, Mary Bly, it's the first child of my old friend, my old friends, Robert and Carol Bly. I feel very proud of this poem, but it's one of those times that, it signifies one of those times in my life when I really thought of something nice to do and did it. So many things I want to do that would be nice, and usually they turn out to be something either asinine or too late, or something. But I wrote this poem for little Mary's christening, and I had it, it's the only time I've ever done this, I had it specially printed on very nice paper and print and had it put in a little silver frame, and gave it to her mother, on the day of the christening. What a calm thing to pull on an audience, how can you help but like it. [Audience laughter]. If you don't like it, it means you don't like motherhood or small children, no. \"Mary Bly\".\n \nJames Wright\n00:49:51\nReads \"Mary Bly\" [from The Branch Will Not Break].\n\nJames Wright\n00:50:42\nAnd I think I will conclude with a poem which is just a description. There were some other descriptive poems in my last book which, for some weird reason, drove some reviewers to distraction. For example, in one poem, there was a poem about being at a bus stop at a place in Ohio and looking out the window and seeing a farmer at the beginning of a rain calling his cows in, and one reviewer got terribly upset about this and said, how...he's only stopping there on the bus, how did he know that there were a hundred black and white Holsteins. [Audience laughter]. And Robert Bly urged me and urged me to send the reviewer a postcard. I never did it, I wish I had. It was to have said, \"I counted the tits and divided by four.\" [Audience laughter]. Well, no but, just, I just want to present this poem. It's called \"A Blessing\", and for what it is, it's just a description of something. \n \nJames Wright\n00:52:28\nReads \"A Blessing\" [from The Branch Will Not Break].\n \nJames Wright\n00:54:02\nThank you. \n \nAudience\n00:54:03\nApplause. \n \nIntroducer\n00:54:21\nI'd just like to express all our thanks to James Wright [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q6145850] for sharing his poetry and his curses and blessings with us tonight, and to remind you that the next reading in the series is by Muriel Rukeyser [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q735177] on Friday, January 24th. \n \nEND\n00:54:38\n",

This is called \"Vision of Childhood''.\n \nRon Loewinsohn\n00:08:15\nReads \"Vision of Childhood\" [from Meat Air: Poems 1957-1969].\n \nRon Loewinsohn\n00:10:33\nThis is called \"Lots of Lakes\".\n \nRon Loewinsohn\n00:10:37\nReads \"Lots of Lakes\" [from Meat Air: Poems 1957-1969].\n \nRon Loewinsohn\n00:12:03\nThis is called \"The Sea, Around Us\".\n \nRon Loewinsohn\n00:12:17\nReads \"The Sea, Around Us\" [from The Sea, Around Us].\n \nRon Loewinsohn\n00:15:59\nI want to read some, most of the poems from this section called \"Book of Ayres\", and I want to explain just a little bit about it if I can, I guess the most important thing to say is that they declared themselves as a book of poems, in the middle of a final exam, I was taking an exam and one of the things that we had to deal with was a poem by Emily Dickinson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4441], which I will read to you, it's a marvelous poem, I'd never seen it before. And it's so clearly tied all of the poems I'd been working on for the past year or so together, into a bundle, into a package. Let me read to you the, this little statement which I'd written for the publication of the book, and I, simply to insist that they are before anything else, religious poems, and I, as prepossessing as I am about them now, because I think that I may have occasion later on in the reading to call that, or you may have occasion to call that to mind. That they take, as their focus, the making, the finding of the flesh in the word, that is that the word is flesh and it has to be found as such. But let me just read this statement and then I'll read you the Emily Dickinson poem, we'll go right into the \u201cBook of Ayres\u201d. I hope that they're, also, that they're fun, and then you say 'religion', people say, 'uh-oh', this is going to be very grim and very heavy, and in the old sense of heavy. But I hope we can have fun with them, but simply, let me do this. All the poems in the \u201cBook of Ayres\u201d section Meat Air, were written with the intention, though not entirely conscious \u2018til rather late in the series, of making the word flesh. That is, when the poet speaks, his words are physically only air, yet they can afford us the most sensorially tangible of experiences. Further, the poem, though merely air, is what sustains us, what the soul feeds on. The poet speaks to keep the soul of man alive, that's Yeats [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q40213] in  \u201cJohn Kinsella's Lament for Mrs. Mary Moore\u201d, it's interesting that as I was grabbing for something to, for support, picked that line, because the line continues, or rather the whole passage goes \"And oh, but she had stories, though not for the priest's ear, to keep the soul of man alive, to banish age and care, and being old, she put a skin on everything she said.\" Or as Williams [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q178106] puts it, \"It is difficult, to get the news from poems, yet we die, every day, for lack of what is found there.\" Yet if the word seeks to take on the actuality of flesh, of substance, substance itself, as the poet apprehends it, in the merest of tales of his life, from day to day, seeks to take on the resonating actuality of speech, to realize itself in the actuality of the word. Love itself is both a word and a continuing act or process, both an idea and a tension in the chest, viscera and genitals, a pressure toward articulation so complex that it often stifles speech. About halfway through \u201cThe Book of Ayres\u201d, I realized that many of the poems I'd written over the past twelve years or so, had been attempting with various degrees of success to effect these transubstantiations and so, this collection. \"The Dickinson Poem\", which if you want to take a look at it is in Thomas Johnson's editions, it's number \u201c1651\u201d.\n \nRon Loewinsohn\n00:20:02 \nReads \"Poem 1651\" by Emily Dickinson.\n \nRon Loewinsohn\n00:20:49\nAnd one last note before starting in the book has an epigraph from Jim St. Jim. \"I need to take a new tack, and sit on it.\" The first poem's called \"\u2019These Worlds Have Always Moved in Harmony\u2019\".\n \nRon Loewinsohn\n00:21:11\nReads \"\u2019These Worlds Have Always Moved in Harmony\u2019\" [from Meat Air: Poems 1957-1969].\n \nUnknown\n00:21:20\nAmbient Sound [bell].\n\nRon Loewinsohn\n00:21:22\nWhat the hell is that? I have this terrible recollection of this story I heard about a college in the Midwest in the United States [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30] where a visiting prof came out to give a lecture on Plato [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q859] or something and had this bell go off every fifteen minutes and after, it really unnerved him, and after the end of the lecture, he asked one of the people, like, \"What is that bell going off?\" and the guy, the administrator said \"Oh, that's to keep the students awake.\" I--If that's the case, God bless you, I hope we can do better than that.\n \nRon Loewinsohn\n00:22:08\nReads \"These Worlds Have Always Moved in Harmony\".\n \nRon Loewinsohn\n00:23:34\nAnd this is called \"The Sipapu\".

The last line of the poem, \u201csmoot right to the herte rote\u201d is from Chaucer's translation and it's \"smitten right to the heart's root\".

And so this is sort of called \"Fragments of an Imaginary Noh Play\", and this is the dream that one of the figures has. \n \nRobert Hogg\n00:00:26\nReads \"Fragments of an Imaginary Noh Play - Walkie's Dream\".\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:02:39\nI'd like to read a few selections from my book of poems The Connexions, which was printed in 1965. I'd like to begin with a poem entitled \"The Command\". I should just briefly mention that these poems were all written in a very short period of time between November and January, mostly, and a few poems written later on throughout that spring of 1965. That is, November 1964 through the early part of 1965. Most of them were written in New York and involved an experience I had there where I was very ill, and part of the time delirious. This poem was actually written a little later than some of the poems that follow. They're not spaced out chronologically in the book. \"The Command\".\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:03:34\nReads \"The Command\" from The Connexions.\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:06:20\nThis poem, written, actually, previous to the other, is entitled \"Eclipse\", and it was written without my own, without my knowledge, actually, at the time, that there was an eclipse taking place. It was on the eighteenth of December, 1964, written in New York City. This was a lunar eclipse. Isn't there a lunar eclipse about to...is that tonight? [Audience laughter]. It's a full moon tonight. Something's happening.\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:07:06\nReads \"Eclipse\" from The Connexions.\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:09:12\nThe she of that last stanza enters into this poem, which was originally entitled \"The Changing of Skin\". There's a good, considerable amount of snake imagery in these poems, all of which was the result of having hepatitis and the turning of colours. I had hepatitis rather badly, and relapsed twice with it, and each time I relapsed, of course, I turned bright yellow again. And it was quite an unusual experience, especially the first time, in which I was in the hospital, and the nurses, especially the young nurses, would come round and look at you with the most peculiar eyes, you know, as if you were really something from another world, having changed colour like that. \n \nRobert Hogg\n00:10:02\nReads unnamed poem [originally entitled \u201cThe Changing of Skin\u201d].\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:14:08\nAnother poem connected with this quite closely, another dream poem, entitled \"The Cave\".\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:14:17\nReads \"The Cave\".\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:15:36\nAfter this there's a descent, a further descent down, as has been instructed in an earlier poem, called \"The Command,\" and then a coming-out again. And then a poem that remembers, really, it's quite different, I'm not sure how much this poem really belonged in The Connexions. Most of the poems definitely did belong in the book, I think, though some of them don't bear reading, I don't think, now. This poem bears reading, I think, but doesn't really belong in the book. How's that?\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:16:09\nReads unnamed poem from The Connexions.\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:16:55\nAnd another poem, which was originally titled, \"Poem to Out of This World and Soul Lies\", was really written with John Sinclair [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q706977] in mind, whom I hope all of you keep in mind at times, specially now that he's in prison, in Michigan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1166]. It was written to...not written really for him, but written with him in mind, listening to the record \"Out of This World and Soul Lies\" by John Coltrane [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7346].\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:17:23\nReads [\"Out of This World\" , originally entitled \u201cPoem to Out of This World and Soul Lies\u201d].\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:19:09\nAnd the last poem in the collection is entitled, simply, \"Song\".\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:19:16\nReads \"Song\" from The Connexions.\n\nUnknown \n00:19:33\nAmbient Sound [bell].\n\nRobert Hogg\n00:19:34\nHave to change my trunks...Now I'd like to read a few poems that were written not too far removed from the time of The Connexions, some of them, and then moving right on up to the present. This poem titled simply, \"Once\" and the \"once\" is really part of the poem.\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:20:01\nReads \"Once\" [published later in Standing Back]. \n \nRobert Hogg\n00:20:24\nAnd another little poem called \"Tropos\", which means, \"to turn\" in Greek, or \"turning\" in Greek.\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:20:34\nReads \"Tropos\".\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:20:50\nAnother short poem, written some time later, but in the same vein. \"A Fragment of Love\".\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:20:57\nReads \"A Fragment of Love\".\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:21:12\nThis poem was written about four or five years ago also, and was written after having given a tarot reading for a friend. And I take it that most of you will have some familiarity with the tarot cards, and anyway, the poem attempts in several places to explain, in other places just simply to give you the reading of the tarot as it was done out. And so I've just simply in parts just listed the cards that fell. It's simply called \"A Reading\".\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:21:48\nReads \"A Reading\".\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:24:03\nAnd now, a longer poem, a poem that really, in a sense, deals with the subject of poetry, and the subject of love, together. The poem is entitled \"Aries and Pisces Dream\". And really, I supposed, ought to be dedicated to Charles Olson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q922978].\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:24:30\nReads \"Aries and Pisces Dream\" [published later in Standing Back].\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:29:03\nA short, and rather lyrical poem, which was written in response to a letter, not in very good response to a letter, actually...in which the other person asked me if I wouldn't tell them about Psyche [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q843382], what I've defined psyche, which I found was an absolutely impossible thing to do, and something that I hope I can--you could--you know, once you spend one's whole life, I suppose, trying to do it, God help you if you actually get it done, you know. There'd be nothing left to do. This poem is called \"Of Psyche\".\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:29:39\nReads \"Of Psyche\" [published later in Standing Back]. \n \nRobert Hogg\n00:30:26\nA recent poem, entitled \"To the Moon\". The moon gets into a lot of my poems, one way or another. This one woke us up the other night, rather nastily. \n \nRobert Hogg\n00:30:37\nReads \"To the Moon\".\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:31:12\nThis is an untitled poem, a happy poem, I hope, written in September, on the seventh of September, and it struck me, as it was the seventh of September, that in fact, in the Latin, that September is the seventh month, and was apparently the seventh month of the Roman calendar year. And so I was suddenly taken by that, because, you know, if you write dates very often, you probably use the typical numerical method of you know, putting, the day, and the month, and the year, in terms of numbers. And you usually think of September as the ninth month, which in fact it is, in our calendar, but the word is obviously, suggests, as October suggests the eighth month, September is the seventh. And so I was happy. It seemed like something new was happening. It was nice, because you know, in September, in northern, any part of Ottawa [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1930], Ottawa-area, or Ontario [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1904], or Quebec [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q176], you know what's coming, eh? You know, it's still here. So you got to be happy while you can. And it was also, I should add, that even in old times, you know, the calendar year was divided into twelve months, and so the seventh month would, in a sense, be the beginning of a new cycle. It would be six months, and that would end the first half, and there would be six more months, and September would be the first of it again. And that also excited me. It felt like Spring. [Laughter]. But I'm crazy.\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:32:42\nReads untitled poem [published later in Standing Back]. \n \nRobert Hogg\n00:33:05\nAnd now a sad poem, for someone who has, who had cancer, and is apparently alright, which is kind of nice. I think I was pessimistic, I'm always terribly pessimistic about something like that, I don't find it easy to be optimistic in such situations, and optimism, the optimism that I now have again for this person is only as qualified, I dare say. The poem is entitled \"A Lifetime\", and the more I thought about that word--I didn't get the title easily, I had to work it out--and the more I thought about that word, the more it began to mean to me. I think if you really think about that word, lifetime, as one word, it's very peculiar. And then I thought, I was thinking about time-life [audience laughter]. And that really, that was really funny. It's strange, isn't it, that those, that, that corporation should own those two words, as they do. It's very difficult to use them. We can't just call it--like, can you imagine putting out a magazine called Life? You know. Or Poetry magazine. These are very good names for a magazine. Or Time, you know. That's pretty big stuff! [Audience laughter]. What could they--and look what they've done with it, you know. So reduction is still possible [Laughter]. \"A Lifetime\"...And one other thing [laughter] before I begin this one, it's not altogether this way, you've probably, you know, you've probably found that my lines, my poetry, has a tendency, especially in the earlier poems, to be, like they say, poetic, you know, to try to be a little, to try to sound pretty. It was something that meant a great deal to me earlier, and means a little less to me now than it did then, though beauty still means as much to me as ever. I have tried, I have looked for in my poetry--and one thing, it was very pleasant hearing Ron's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2165471] poems tonight, is a quality of voice, a quality of language, that doesn't necessarily try to be pretty at all--that tries to use the language that we are actually living with. I don't mean to try to talk about the old problems of prose and poetry, or anything of the kind. But just that, language needn't necessarily be quote, poetic, unquote. We had kind of a talk about that last night, at the reading in Ottawa, it was pretty funny. And this poem, just at least its beginning, it has that colloquialism that I enjoy.\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:35:37\nReads \"A Lifetime\".\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:37:03\nAnd the last poem that I'd like to read is a poem that is really a freak poem. This poem has taken me at least two years to write, a little longer than two years to write, I think, and has been written over and over and over and over again, and like I said about time\/life, this one has also suffered a phenomenal reduction, starting out as about six pages and ending up as three, which is usually a good sign. Originally there was a line in the poem, something about the presages of civilization, you know, are on my back or in my ear, or something like that, and it was a horrible line. Like a lot of the other lines it had to be excised, and rewritten, and so forth. But the thought of it, the thought of that word, the meaning of that word, contained, lived with me, and lived with my sense of the poem. And so I've entitled it simply, \"Presages\". And also, to make it a little more comprehensible, I've put a sort of bracket, subtitle, \"From a Sixth-Floor Apartment\". Actually, the poem was begun in Manhattan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q11299], not in Manhattan, I'm sorry, in Queens [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q18424], New York, when I was staying at my in-laws' house a little over two years ago, just briefly, and was written from their sixth-floor apartment. It actually, the strange thing about this poem is it was mostly written since then, really re-written, although the first part is pretty much as it was originally.\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:38:24\nReads \"Presages: From a Sixth-Floor Apartment\" [published later in Standing Back].\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:40:40\nThank you.\n \nEND\n00:40:42\n[Cut off abruptly]."

His father was an accountant and his mother founded the Canadian Health League in 1948, and opened the first health food store in the Fraser Valley. After hearing Robert Duncan read from The Opening of the Field, in Vancouver with Frank Davey, he completed a BA at the University of British Columbia. There, he met the members of the newly formed Tish group, and became an integral part of the movement. George Bowering and Hogg published Robert Duncan: An Interview by George Bowering and Robert Hogg (Coach House Press, 1971), which was conducted in 1969. Hogg then went on to complete a Ph.D. from SUNY Buffalo in American Literature. Hogg and his family moved to Ottawa and bought a farm in Mountain Township and began organic farming. In 1968 Hogg began teaching Modern Poetry at Carleton University in Ottawa until he retired in 2005.

Let me start out with, let me start out with one called \"His Music's Like His 20 Children\".\n \nRon Loewinsohn\n00:00:30\nReads \"His Music's Like His 20 Children\" from Meat Air: Poems 1957-1969.\n \nRon Loewinsohn\n00:01:54\nReads [\"It Is to Be Bathed in Light\" from Meat Air: Poems 1957-1969].\n \nRon Loewinsohn\n00:04:25\nThis is called \"Song\".\n \nRon Loewinsohn\n00:04:30\nReads \"Song\" [from Meat Air: Poems 1957-1969, section \u201cL\u2019autre 1967\u201d].\n \nRon Loewinsohn\n00:05:10\nAnd this one called, \"The Rain, The Rain\".\n \nRon Loewinsohn\n00:05:17\nReads \"The Rain, The Rain\" [from Meat Air: Poems 1957-1969].\n \nRon Loewinsohn\n00:06:20\nLet me, let me do one called \"Fuck You With Your Home Run Title\". That title had to be changed, it was originally \"Fuck You Roger Maris [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q741023]\", but Harcourt Brace [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5654997] didn't want to be sued. It's not as if I can't afford it, it's just that it wouldn't do anybody any good. So this is \"Fuck You With Your Home Run Title\".\n \nRon Loewinsohn\n00:07:04\nReads \"Fuck You With Your Home Run Title\" [from Meat Air: Poems 1957-1969].\n \nRon Loewinsohn\n00:07:41\nThe quote \"thoughts of the party were in my head\" is from the World Champion Weight Lifter, who is a Communist Chinese, and after he had pressed some 5,000 lbs or something they said, you know \"You're fantastic, how did you do it?\". And he said \"Thoughts of the party were in my head\". This is called \"Vision of Childhood''.\n \nRon Loewinsohn\n00:08:15\nReads \"Vision of Childhood\" [from Meat Air: Poems 1957-1969].\n \nRon Loewinsohn\n00:10:33\nThis is called \"Lots of Lakes\".\n \nRon Loewinsohn\n00:10:37\nReads \"Lots of Lakes\" [from Meat Air: Poems 1957-1969].\n \nRon Loewinsohn\n00:12:03\nThis is called \"The Sea, Around Us\".\n \nRon Loewinsohn\n00:12:17\nReads \"The Sea, Around Us\" [from The Sea, Around Us].\n \nRon Loewinsohn\n00:15:59\nI want to read some, most of the poems from this section called \"Book of Ayres\", and I want to explain just a little bit about it if I can, I guess the most important thing to say is that they declared themselves as a book of poems, in the middle of a final exam, I was taking an exam and one of the things that we had to deal with was a poem by Emily Dickinson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q4441], which I will read to you, it's a marvelous poem, I'd never seen it before. And it's so clearly tied all of the poems I'd been working on for the past year or so together, into a bundle, into a package. Let me read to you the, this little statement which I'd written for the publication of the book, and I, simply to insist that they are before anything else, religious poems, and I, as prepossessing as I am about them now, because I think that I may have occasion later on in the reading to call that, or you may have occasion to call that to mind. That they take, as their focus, the making, the finding of the flesh in the word, that is that the word is flesh and it has to be found as such. But let me just read this statement and then I'll read you the Emily Dickinson poem, we'll go right into the \u201cBook of Ayres\u201d. I hope that they're, also, that they're fun, and then you say 'religion', people say, 'uh-oh', this is going to be very grim and very heavy, and in the old sense of heavy. But I hope we can have fun with them, but simply, let me do this. All the poems in the \u201cBook of Ayres\u201d section Meat Air, were written with the intention, though not entirely conscious \u2018til rather late in the series, of making the word flesh. That is, when the poet speaks, his words are physically only air, yet they can afford us the most sensorially tangible of experiences. Further, the poem, though merely air, is what sustains us, what the soul feeds on. The poet speaks to keep the soul of man alive, that's Yeats [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q40213] in  \u201cJohn Kinsella's Lament for Mrs. Mary Moore\u201d, it's interesting that as I was grabbing for something to, for support, picked that line, because the line continues, or rather the whole passage goes \"And oh, but she had stories, though not for the priest's ear, to keep the soul of man alive, to banish age and care, and being old, she put a skin on everything she said.\" Or as Williams [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q178106] puts it, \"It is difficult, to get the news from poems, yet we die, every day, for lack of what is found there.\" Yet if the word seeks to take on the actuality of flesh, of substance, substance itself, as the poet apprehends it, in the merest of tales of his life, from day to day, seeks to take on the resonating actuality of speech, to realize itself in the actuality of the word. Love itself is both a word and a continuing act or process, both an idea and a tension in the chest, viscera and genitals, a pressure toward articulation so complex that it often stifles speech. About halfway through \u201cThe Book of Ayres\u201d, I realized that many of the poems I'd written over the past twelve years or so, had been attempting with various degrees of success to effect these transubstantiations and so, this collection. \"The Dickinson Poem\", which if you want to take a look at it is in Thomas Johnson's editions, it's number \u201c1651\u201d.\n \nRon Loewinsohn\n00:20:02 \nReads \"Poem 1651\" by Emily Dickinson.\n \nRon Loewinsohn\n00:20:49\nAnd one last note before starting in the book has an epigraph from Jim St. Jim. \"I need to take a new tack, and sit on it.\" The first poem's called \"\u2019These Worlds Have Always Moved in Harmony\u2019\".\n \nRon Loewinsohn\n00:21:11\nReads \"\u2019These Worlds Have Always Moved in Harmony\u2019\" [from Meat Air: Poems 1957-1969].\n \nUnknown\n00:21:20\nAmbient Sound [bell].\n\nRon Loewinsohn\n00:21:22\nWhat the hell is that? I have this terrible recollection of this story I heard about a college in the Midwest in the United States [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q30] where a visiting prof came out to give a lecture on Plato [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q859] or something and had this bell go off every fifteen minutes and after, it really unnerved him, and after the end of the lecture, he asked one of the people, like, \"What is that bell going off?\" and the guy, the administrator said \"Oh, that's to keep the students awake.\" I--If that's the case, God bless you, I hope we can do better than that.\n \nRon Loewinsohn\n00:22:08\nReads \"These Worlds Have Always Moved in Harmony\".\n \nRon Loewinsohn\n00:23:34\nAnd this is called \"The Sipapu\".

                "contents": "robert_hogg_i086-11-023.mp3 [File 2 of 2]\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:00:00\nI'd like to open the reading with a poem that's really part of a verse-play that I wrote in 1963 or 64, a long time ago, a play that never really made it as a play, but fragments of which I've salvaged because I like, I like what they do. And so this is sort of called \"Fragments of an Imaginary Noh Play\", and this is the dream that one of the figures has. \n \nRobert Hogg\n00:00:26\nReads \"Fragments of an Imaginary Noh Play - Walkie's Dream\".\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:02:39\nI'd like to read a few selections from my book of poems The Connexions, which was printed in 1965. I'd like to begin with a poem entitled \"The Command\". I should just briefly mention that these poems were all written in a very short period of time between November and January, mostly, and a few poems written later on throughout that spring of 1965. That is, November 1964 through the early part of 1965. Most of them were written in New York and involved an experience I had there where I was very ill, and part of the time delirious. This poem was actually written a little later than some of the poems that follow. They're not spaced out chronologically in the book. \"The Command\".\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:03:34\nReads \"The Command\" from The Connexions.\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:06:20\nThis poem, written, actually, previous to the other, is entitled \"Eclipse\", and it was written without my own, without my knowledge, actually, at the time, that there was an eclipse taking place. It was on the eighteenth of December, 1964, written in New York City. This was a lunar eclipse. Isn't there a lunar eclipse about to...is that tonight? [Audience laughter]. It's a full moon tonight. Something's happening.\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:07:06\nReads \"Eclipse\" from The Connexions.\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:09:12\nThe she of that last stanza enters into this poem, which was originally entitled \"The Changing of Skin\". There's a good, considerable amount of snake imagery in these poems, all of which was the result of having hepatitis and the turning of colours. I had hepatitis rather badly, and relapsed twice with it, and each time I relapsed, of course, I turned bright yellow again. And it was quite an unusual experience, especially the first time, in which I was in the hospital, and the nurses, especially the young nurses, would come round and look at you with the most peculiar eyes, you know, as if you were really something from another world, having changed colour like that. \n \nRobert Hogg\n00:10:02\nReads unnamed poem [originally entitled \u201cThe Changing of Skin\u201d].\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:14:08\nAnother poem connected with this quite closely, another dream poem, entitled \"The Cave\".\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:14:17\nReads \"The Cave\".\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:15:36\nAfter this there's a descent, a further descent down, as has been instructed in an earlier poem, called \"The Command,\" and then a coming-out again. And then a poem that remembers, really, it's quite different, I'm not sure how much this poem really belonged in The Connexions. Most of the poems definitely did belong in the book, I think, though some of them don't bear reading, I don't think, now. This poem bears reading, I think, but doesn't really belong in the book. How's that?\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:16:09\nReads unnamed poem from The Connexions.\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:16:55\nAnd another poem, which was originally titled, \"Poem to Out of This World and Soul Lies\", was really written with John Sinclair [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q706977] in mind, whom I hope all of you keep in mind at times, specially now that he's in prison, in Michigan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1166]. It was written to...not written really for him, but written with him in mind, listening to the record \"Out of This World and Soul Lies\" by John Coltrane [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q7346].\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:17:23\nReads [\"Out of This World\" , originally entitled \u201cPoem to Out of This World and Soul Lies\u201d].\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:19:09\nAnd the last poem in the collection is entitled, simply, \"Song\".\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:19:16\nReads \"Song\" from The Connexions.\n\nUnknown \n00:19:33\nAmbient Sound [bell].\n\nRobert Hogg\n00:19:34\nHave to change my trunks...Now I'd like to read a few poems that were written not too far removed from the time of The Connexions, some of them, and then moving right on up to the present. This poem titled simply, \"Once\" and the \"once\" is really part of the poem.\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:20:01\nReads \"Once\" [published later in Standing Back]. \n \nRobert Hogg\n00:20:24\nAnd another little poem called \"Tropos\", which means, \"to turn\" in Greek, or \"turning\" in Greek.\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:20:34\nReads \"Tropos\".\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:20:50\nAnother short poem, written some time later, but in the same vein. \"A Fragment of Love\".\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:20:57\nReads \"A Fragment of Love\".\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:21:12\nThis poem was written about four or five years ago also, and was written after having given a tarot reading for a friend. And I take it that most of you will have some familiarity with the tarot cards, and anyway, the poem attempts in several places to explain, in other places just simply to give you the reading of the tarot as it was done out. And so I've just simply in parts just listed the cards that fell. It's simply called \"A Reading\".\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:21:48\nReads \"A Reading\".\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:24:03\nAnd now, a longer poem, a poem that really, in a sense, deals with the subject of poetry, and the subject of love, together. The poem is entitled \"Aries and Pisces Dream\". And really, I supposed, ought to be dedicated to Charles Olson [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q922978].\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:24:30\nReads \"Aries and Pisces Dream\" [published later in Standing Back].\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:29:03\nA short, and rather lyrical poem, which was written in response to a letter, not in very good response to a letter, actually...in which the other person asked me if I wouldn't tell them about Psyche [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q843382], what I've defined psyche, which I found was an absolutely impossible thing to do, and something that I hope I can--you could--you know, once you spend one's whole life, I suppose, trying to do it, God help you if you actually get it done, you know. There'd be nothing left to do. This poem is called \"Of Psyche\".\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:29:39\nReads \"Of Psyche\" [published later in Standing Back]. \n \nRobert Hogg\n00:30:26\nA recent poem, entitled \"To the Moon\". The moon gets into a lot of my poems, one way or another. This one woke us up the other night, rather nastily. \n \nRobert Hogg\n00:30:37\nReads \"To the Moon\".\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:31:12\nThis is an untitled poem, a happy poem, I hope, written in September, on the seventh of September, and it struck me, as it was the seventh of September, that in fact, in the Latin, that September is the seventh month, and was apparently the seventh month of the Roman calendar year. And so I was suddenly taken by that, because, you know, if you write dates very often, you probably use the typical numerical method of you know, putting, the day, and the month, and the year, in terms of numbers. And you usually think of September as the ninth month, which in fact it is, in our calendar, but the word is obviously, suggests, as October suggests the eighth month, September is the seventh. And so I was happy. It seemed like something new was happening. It was nice, because you know, in September, in northern, any part of Ottawa [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1930], Ottawa-area, or Ontario [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1904], or Quebec [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q176], you know what's coming, eh? You know, it's still here. So you got to be happy while you can. And it was also, I should add, that even in old times, you know, the calendar year was divided into twelve months, and so the seventh month would, in a sense, be the beginning of a new cycle. It would be six months, and that would end the first half, and there would be six more months, and September would be the first of it again. And that also excited me. It felt like Spring. [Laughter]. But I'm crazy.\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:32:42\nReads untitled poem [published later in Standing Back]. \n \nRobert Hogg\n00:33:05\nAnd now a sad poem, for someone who has, who had cancer, and is apparently alright, which is kind of nice. I think I was pessimistic, I'm always terribly pessimistic about something like that, I don't find it easy to be optimistic in such situations, and optimism, the optimism that I now have again for this person is only as qualified, I dare say. The poem is entitled \"A Lifetime\", and the more I thought about that word--I didn't get the title easily, I had to work it out--and the more I thought about that word, the more it began to mean to me. I think if you really think about that word, lifetime, as one word, it's very peculiar. And then I thought, I was thinking about time-life [audience laughter]. And that really, that was really funny. It's strange, isn't it, that those, that, that corporation should own those two words, as they do. It's very difficult to use them. We can't just call it--like, can you imagine putting out a magazine called Life? You know. Or Poetry magazine. These are very good names for a magazine. Or Time, you know. That's pretty big stuff! [Audience laughter]. What could they--and look what they've done with it, you know. So reduction is still possible [Laughter]. \"A Lifetime\"...And one other thing [laughter] before I begin this one, it's not altogether this way, you've probably, you know, you've probably found that my lines, my poetry, has a tendency, especially in the earlier poems, to be, like they say, poetic, you know, to try to be a little, to try to sound pretty. It was something that meant a great deal to me earlier, and means a little less to me now than it did then, though beauty still means as much to me as ever. I have tried, I have looked for in my poetry--and one thing, it was very pleasant hearing Ron's [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2165471] poems tonight, is a quality of voice, a quality of language, that doesn't necessarily try to be pretty at all--that tries to use the language that we are actually living with. I don't mean to try to talk about the old problems of prose and poetry, or anything of the kind. But just that, language needn't necessarily be quote, poetic, unquote. We had kind of a talk about that last night, at the reading in Ottawa, it was pretty funny. And this poem, just at least its beginning, it has that colloquialism that I enjoy.\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:35:37\nReads \"A Lifetime\".\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:37:03\nAnd the last poem that I'd like to read is a poem that is really a freak poem. This poem has taken me at least two years to write, a little longer than two years to write, I think, and has been written over and over and over and over again, and like I said about time\/life, this one has also suffered a phenomenal reduction, starting out as about six pages and ending up as three, which is usually a good sign. Originally there was a line in the poem, something about the presages of civilization, you know, are on my back or in my ear, or something like that, and it was a horrible line. Like a lot of the other lines it had to be excised, and rewritten, and so forth. But the thought of it, the thought of that word, the meaning of that word, contained, lived with me, and lived with my sense of the poem. And so I've entitled it simply, \"Presages\". And also, to make it a little more comprehensible, I've put a sort of bracket, subtitle, \"From a Sixth-Floor Apartment\". Actually, the poem was begun in Manhattan [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q11299], not in Manhattan, I'm sorry, in Queens [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q18424], New York, when I was staying at my in-laws' house a little over two years ago, just briefly, and was written from their sixth-floor apartment. It actually, the strange thing about this poem is it was mostly written since then, really re-written, although the first part is pretty much as it was originally.\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:38:24\nReads \"Presages: From a Sixth-Floor Apartment\" [published later in Standing Back].\n \nRobert Hogg\n00:40:40\nThank you.\n \nEND\n00:40:42\n[Cut off abruptly].",

Add a few new poems. It's a book with poems that are not, some poems that are not, in any sense in theory, or are less important than others, but it moves from one tangle of threads to the next, so it moves in various stages or groups, but I'll read at least one poem from each group, so I think that'll make a story. This is the first poem in the book, and this is the presentation that decided me on the book. What the book, in a way, pushes against.\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:01:02\nReads \"In His Image\" [published later in Threads].\n\nDavid Bromige\n00:02:01\nReads \"After the Engraving\" [published later in Threads].\n\nDavid Bromige\n00:03:07\nAnd I got this take, this poem was printed in a magazine that George Bowering [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1239280] edits, Imago, Number 13, I think.\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:03:21\nReads \"First Love\" [published later in Threads].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:07:08\nSee, what I was working there was both the delightful self-indulgence of being able to tell that story over to myself after so many years, but, what I had coming out in the poem before, the one about the light elves who danced the dark elves out into the light in order to petrify them, as an Anglo-Saxon, Teutonic conception, which has a lot to do with our idea of what a poem is or what a work of art is. And so then I had this matter of the one you love coming to you and enabling you to be both light and dark elf to yourself, so that the two of you...whose particular form had never been, without her, it was that cultural attachment to particular forms, also, that I was hoping to tell the story, part of the story of, again, there. Okay, here's \u201cPsychoanalysis\u201d.\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:08:23\nReads \u201cPsychoanalysis\u201d [published later in Threads].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:08:32\nReads \"You Too\" [published later in Threads].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:08:52\nReads \"Why I Went There\" [published later in Threads].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:10:54\nReads \"I Can't Read, & Here's a Book\" [published later in Threads].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:12:27\nAnd so, yeah, and then that shifts into this prose piece, \"They Want\".\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:12:33\nReads \"They Want\" [published later in Threads].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:14:11\nThis one came out of the same meeting.\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:14:14\nReads \"I can See\" [published later in Threads].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:14:31\nReads \"Only Fair\" [published later in Threads].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:14:59\nReads \"Example\u201d [published later in Threads].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:15:11\nYeah, this would seem to be very useful here. \"Choosing the Event\". This came out of the troubles, the people's park troubles in Berkeley [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q168756]. Whenever it was, I can't remember now, the year before last, I guess.\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:15:34\nReads \"Choosing the Event\" [published later in Threads].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:17:18\nReads \"Logical Conclusions\" [published later in Threads].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:17:47\nI still don't know who it was. I figure if I keep reading it, sooner or later someone's going to break. But it's not very likely here. \"An Invention\".\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:18:07\nReads \"An Invention\" [published later in Threads].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:18:49\nReads \"Fond\" [published later in Threads].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:19:45\nReads \"So\" [published later in Threads].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:22:19\nAnd so I want to read a poem from my first book. It was written in Vancouver [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q24639], of Vancouver. Well, I'm not a...particular landscapes don't often come into my poetry but here all kinds of images came in, from Hampstead Heath [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1570958], near where I spent my childhood, and also of Vancouver, and this poem also was published in TISH [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2384384], a publication from those Vancouver days.\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:22:52\nReads \"We Could Get a Drink\" from The Gathering.\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:24:57\nI'll read a few poems now from the book between--that was from a book called The Gathering. This is from The Ends of the Earth. And these, in their literal presence, these woods were the woods behind Deep Cove [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5250114], where I was living in 1964, just up from Vancouver.\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:25:24\nReads \"In Deep Woods\" from The Ends of the Earth.\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:26:17\nThis goes back to back with that, I guess. \n \nDavid Bromige\n00:26:20\nReads \"Just Think\" [from The Ends of the Earth].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:26:57\nReads \"A Defect\" [from The Ends of the Earth].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:27:32\nReads \"Taking Heart\" [from The Ends of the Earth].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:28:11\nReads \"The Faster\" [from The Ends of the Earth].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:28:45\nReads \"Why Not\" [from The Ends of the Earth].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:29:25\nReads \"A Call\" [from The Ends of the Earth].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:30:35\nThis is a...it's my own attempt to write a fairy story. And I just let come into it all the elements that I knew from various fairy stories, narrative tricks and devices and so forth, and tried to have my fun from them, but I didn't get away with it. They took me, even though I held off, as well as I could.\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:31:03\nReads \"A Final Mission\" [from The Ends of the Earth].\n \nAudience\n00:38:04\nApplause.\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:38:11\nThat's the closest, I guess, to a political poem I've ever written. [Audience laughter]. So I want a bit to break that mood, because I can't do anything more with that mood.\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:38:23\nReads \"A Kind Numbness\" [from The Ends of the Earth].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:39:19\nI like that very much, that notion of the bargain by which we civilized beings live, it comes through for me very strongly there, but also, I mean when the sun gets up the flies get up, but also that you can focus on one or the other. Let's see how I'm doing for time. Okay, I'll read...I sent the manuscript of Threads off to the publisher about two months ago, and these are the poems I've written since then.\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:40:06\nReads \"Dear Night\".\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:42:29\nReads \"The Spell\" [published later in Ten Years in the Making: selected poems, songs & stories 1961-1970].\n\nDavid Bromige\n00:44:46\nReads \"Tom Thumb: A Relation on a Measure\".\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:48:23\nReads \"A Rime\" [published later in Ten Years in the Making: selected poems, songs & stories 1961-1970].\n \nUnknown\n00:48:26\n[Cut or edit made in tape; poem title is repeated]. \n \nDavid Bromige\n00:50:26\nReads \"From my Mother\".\n \nEND\n00:52:18\n"

Bromige then left for Canada, to pursue an undergraduate degree in English from the University of British Columbia. There he met George Bowering and the Tish group of poets, and worked as an editor for the UBC newspaper. In 1962, he graduated and was offered a scholarship to complete his Master\u2019s Degree from the University of California at Berkeley. He completed both his M.A. (1964) and his Ph.D. (1970), when he began teaching at the Sonoma State University in 1970, a position he held until his retirement 23 years later. His first publication was The Gathering (Sumbooks, 1965), which was followed by The Ends of the Earth (Black Sparrow Press, 1968), Please, Like Me (Black Sparrow Press, 1968) and Threads (Black Sparrow Press, 1971). Bromige was involved in the San Francisco poetry renaissance of the late 1960\u2019s and early 1970\u2019s. He then published Birds of the West (Coach House Press, 1973), Ten Years in the Making: Selected Poems, Songs & Stories, 1961-1970 (Vancouver Community Press, 1973), Three Stories (Black Sparrow Press, 1973), Out of my Hands (Black Sparrow Press, 1974) and Tight Corners & What\u2019s Around Them: Prose & Poems (Black Sparrow Press, 1974). Bromige has published over forty volumes of prose and poetry, including Living in Advance (Open Ready Press, 1976), My Poetry (The Figures press, 1980), Desire: Selected Poems 1963-1987 (Black Sparrow Press, 1988) which won a Western States Arts Federation award, Piccolo Mondo (Coach House Press Books, 1998) with Angela and George Bowering and Michael Matthews, As in T, As in Tether (Chax Press, 2002), Ten Poems from Clearings in the Throat (dPress, 2005) and his last collection, with Richard Denner, Spade (dPress, 2006). Bromige\u2019s many honours include a Pushcart Prize, two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and two awards from the Poetry Foundation.

                "contents": "David Bromige\n00:00:00\n...the new book, Threads, that hasn't been published yet, and then I'm going to read some poems from the book The Ends of the Earth, that came out a couple of years ago. Add a few new poems. It's a book with poems that are not, some poems that are not, in any sense in theory, or are less important than others, but it moves from one tangle of threads to the next, so it moves in various stages or groups, but I'll read at least one poem from each group, so I think that'll make a story. This is the first poem in the book, and this is the presentation that decided me on the book. What the book, in a way, pushes against.\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:01:02\nReads \"In His Image\" [published later in Threads].\n\nDavid Bromige\n00:02:01\nReads \"After the Engraving\" [published later in Threads].\n\nDavid Bromige\n00:03:07\nAnd I got this take, this poem was printed in a magazine that George Bowering [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1239280] edits, Imago, Number 13, I think.\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:03:21\nReads \"First Love\" [published later in Threads].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:07:08\nSee, what I was working there was both the delightful self-indulgence of being able to tell that story over to myself after so many years, but, what I had coming out in the poem before, the one about the light elves who danced the dark elves out into the light in order to petrify them, as an Anglo-Saxon, Teutonic conception, which has a lot to do with our idea of what a poem is or what a work of art is. And so then I had this matter of the one you love coming to you and enabling you to be both light and dark elf to yourself, so that the two of you...whose particular form had never been, without her, it was that cultural attachment to particular forms, also, that I was hoping to tell the story, part of the story of, again, there. Okay, here's \u201cPsychoanalysis\u201d.\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:08:23\nReads \u201cPsychoanalysis\u201d [published later in Threads].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:08:32\nReads \"You Too\" [published later in Threads].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:08:52\nReads \"Why I Went There\" [published later in Threads].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:10:54\nReads \"I Can't Read, & Here's a Book\" [published later in Threads].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:12:27\nAnd so, yeah, and then that shifts into this prose piece, \"They Want\".\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:12:33\nReads \"They Want\" [published later in Threads].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:14:11\nThis one came out of the same meeting.\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:14:14\nReads \"I can See\" [published later in Threads].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:14:31\nReads \"Only Fair\" [published later in Threads].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:14:59\nReads \"Example\u201d [published later in Threads].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:15:11\nYeah, this would seem to be very useful here. \"Choosing the Event\". This came out of the troubles, the people's park troubles in Berkeley [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q168756]. Whenever it was, I can't remember now, the year before last, I guess.\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:15:34\nReads \"Choosing the Event\" [published later in Threads].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:17:18\nReads \"Logical Conclusions\" [published later in Threads].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:17:47\nI still don't know who it was. I figure if I keep reading it, sooner or later someone's going to break. But it's not very likely here. \"An Invention\".\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:18:07\nReads \"An Invention\" [published later in Threads].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:18:49\nReads \"Fond\" [published later in Threads].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:19:45\nReads \"So\" [published later in Threads].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:22:19\nAnd so I want to read a poem from my first book. It was written in Vancouver [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q24639], of Vancouver. Well, I'm not a...particular landscapes don't often come into my poetry but here all kinds of images came in, from Hampstead Heath [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q1570958], near where I spent my childhood, and also of Vancouver, and this poem also was published in TISH [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q2384384], a publication from those Vancouver days.\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:22:52\nReads \"We Could Get a Drink\" from The Gathering.\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:24:57\nI'll read a few poems now from the book between--that was from a book called The Gathering. This is from The Ends of the Earth. And these, in their literal presence, these woods were the woods behind Deep Cove [https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/wiki\/Q5250114], where I was living in 1964, just up from Vancouver.\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:25:24\nReads \"In Deep Woods\" from The Ends of the Earth.\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:26:17\nThis goes back to back with that, I guess. \n \nDavid Bromige\n00:26:20\nReads \"Just Think\" [from The Ends of the Earth].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:26:57\nReads \"A Defect\" [from The Ends of the Earth].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:27:32\nReads \"Taking Heart\" [from The Ends of the Earth].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:28:11\nReads \"The Faster\" [from The Ends of the Earth].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:28:45\nReads \"Why Not\" [from The Ends of the Earth].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:29:25\nReads \"A Call\" [from The Ends of the Earth].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:30:35\nThis is a...it's my own attempt to write a fairy story. And I just let come into it all the elements that I knew from various fairy stories, narrative tricks and devices and so forth, and tried to have my fun from them, but I didn't get away with it. They took me, even though I held off, as well as I could.\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:31:03\nReads \"A Final Mission\" [from The Ends of the Earth].\n \nAudience\n00:38:04\nApplause.\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:38:11\nThat's the closest, I guess, to a political poem I've ever written. [Audience laughter]. So I want a bit to break that mood, because I can't do anything more with that mood.\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:38:23\nReads \"A Kind Numbness\" [from The Ends of the Earth].\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:39:19\nI like that very much, that notion of the bargain by which we civilized beings live, it comes through for me very strongly there, but also, I mean when the sun gets up the flies get up, but also that you can focus on one or the other. Let's see how I'm doing for time. Okay, I'll read...I sent the manuscript of Threads off to the publisher about two months ago, and these are the poems I've written since then.\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:40:06\nReads \"Dear Night\".\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:42:29\nReads \"The Spell\" [published later in Ten Years in the Making: selected poems, songs & stories 1961-1970].\n\nDavid Bromige\n00:44:46\nReads \"Tom Thumb: A Relation on a Measure\".\n \nDavid Bromige\n00:48:23\nReads \"A Rime\" [published later in Ten Years in the Making: selected poems, songs & stories 1961-1970].\n \nUnknown\n00:48:26\n[Cut or edit made in tape; poem title is repeated]. \n \nDavid Bromige\n00:50:26\nReads \"From my Mother\".\n \nEND\n00:52:18\n",
